=========

Thinking about mutable statics alawys brings the following Chris Rock quote to mind 

> Ten million records sold, and I cant find one person that will admit to buying one. The Spice Girls are kinda like heroin you know somebodys doing it, but nobody admits it.

Ask a developer about mutable statics and they will all respond the same way

> Mutable statics are the devil, don't ever use them

Ask the same developer to open up their code and go through their statics and suddenly they'll be singing a very different tune.
