title: Linux Then and Now
---

Even though I've worked at Microsoft for 10+ years now, at one point in my life I was quite the Linux enthusiast.  I had a small cluster of linux boxes in my house, ran SVN servers for a group of people, regular attendee at the Georgia Tech LUG, etc ...  

It's been ~7 years though since I had a running Linux box in my house. I'd recently gotten frustrate running jekyll on my Windows box and decided it was time to put my old desktop back to use again.  

Wondered if things had changed

I decided to run with Ubuntu as my distro.  Debian was my long favorite distro and Ubuntu seemed to be the best version of Debian at the moment.  *crappy section*

What I was really curious about though was had Linux really gotten better in the 7 years since I'd been using it.

The problems haven't really changed but the answers are a heck of a lot better and much more accessible.
