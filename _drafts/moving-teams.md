For the last four years I've been a part of a research team exploring extensions to the C# language.  The effort focussed on adding features that improved the reliability, performance and overall correctness of the language.  Like any good research project we had some features that were incredibly successful, some which were so-so and others that ... well ... they failed spectacularly!  

The project was amazing to work on but like all good things eventually it must come to an end.  Research is great fun but a part of me missed engaging with customers and the joys (and horrors) of shipping code.  As such I've recently decided to accept a position on C# Language team.  

For the moment I'm heads down with the rest of the team trying to get Roslyn and Visual Studio 2015 out the door.  In the near future the design for C# 7.0 will begin.  When that happens I will be hard at work trying to integrate the goodness that came out of my research team back into the language.  

I do want to emphasize *trying* above.  Certainly not everything, or even most of it, will make it into the language.  There were plenty of successful features that just don't make sense in the general context of C#.  Even the features I hope to bring back will inevitably need to change a bit to be ship ready.  

That does raise the question though: what features were we working on?

With the exception of the [OOPSLA paper](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/170528/msr-tr-2012-79.pdf) I've been mostly silent since I joined the research team.  The need to be quiet about your work is the big downside to research (especially for chatty people like me).  But now the research is concluded and I'll be able to once again blog about my work including most of what I worked on the last four years. 

Even though I'm incredibly excited to be rejoining the Managed Languages team I will sorely miss my old team.  My language team was a part of a larger operating system research effort that had shared goals around reliability and performance.  The overall team had a level of rigour, dedication and drive that I've never experienced before (but desparately hope to experience again).  I will definitely miss the work and the people involved in it.

For the last four years I've been working on a research team exploring extensions to the C# language.  My group was a part of a larger operating system project that had shared goals around reliability, performance and correct by construction.  The overall team had a level of rigour, dedication and drive that I've never experienced before (but desperately hope to experience again).  

The project was amazing but like all good things it must come to an end.  As such I've recently accepted a position on the C# Language team.  

Like any good research project we made features that were wildly succesful, midly successful and some that just failed spectacularly.  One of my goals in my new position is to try and bring back those features which were successful to the shipping languages.

I've spent the last four years working on a technical incubation project.  The team was focused on reliability, performance and correctness in a way I've never experienced before (but desperately hope to again).  The people were amazing and the experiences humbling at times but it was an amazing adventure. 

technical incubation means shipping
My next role 
I've recently accepted a new position at Microsoft working on the C# Language team.  T

This is a new and old role for me.  

They also had a good deal of tolerance for experimentation.  


That raises the question: what have I been working on these last four years? 

Ever since I left the Managed Languages team I've been working on a operating system and language research project.  My main focus was extending the C# language to add performance and reliability features.  

The downside of working on a research project is the need to be fairly quiet about it.  This is painful for a person like me who is used to talking and talking and talking.

The good news is that now that I am out of research i can talk about my work.

My specific role was extending the C# language to add performance and reliability features.  Much of this work

While I'm happy to be back in Managed Languages again I will miss my previous job.  The people and performance results driven culture will be hard to replicate.
