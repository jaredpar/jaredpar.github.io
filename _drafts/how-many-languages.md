This is a question that doesn't have a right answer.  It is highly dependent on the type of environment that you are working in and what your daily tasks entail.  

It does however have a wrong answer: one language.  



This is a question that doesn't have a definite correct answer but does have a wrong answer.  That answer is one.  I don't know of a single professional programmer that lives day by day in a single language.  Programmers must be polygots these days to survive.  

Developers need to be able to pick up a new language in a matter of days.  Not become an expert but be able to read it and possibly fix small bugs.  This is an invaluable skill. 

My personal take on this question is the following:

1. Become as close to an expert as possible in one language.  
2. Be able to write simple programs in at least two other langauges.

All languages share common properties: variables, control structures, abstraction, modules, etc ...  Becoming an expert in one language is sufficient to expose a programmer to these concepts and how to best leverage them in a program.  

Learning to program in other languages teaches a programmer how to tranlate the skills to other environments.  Once this skill is learned it's easy to repeat over and over again.  Picking
