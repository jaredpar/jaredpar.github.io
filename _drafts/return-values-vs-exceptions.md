title: Return Values vs. Exceptions: They Both Suck

My opinion on this is pretty simple: they both suck.  Ideally error handling in programming should have at least the following two properies

1. The code flow of errors should be visible to the casual observer 
2. Error scenarios cannot be silently ignored
