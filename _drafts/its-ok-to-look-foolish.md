title: It is okay to look foolish
---

Part of growing as a developer is being able to spot and correct bad habbits.  As I've grown and had more success I've found that I'm more reluctant to ask questions than I was as a junior developer.  I think this all comes down to fear of looking foolish.  

As a junior developer I had nothing to lose, no reputation to be tarnished by asking questions which may have ridiculously easy answers.  Through the years though I've been succesful, grown in responsibility and built up a solid reputation for obscure facts about languages and APIs.  

It's also quite possibly the dumbest mentality that I've had.  


The more success you have as a programmer the more tempting it is to hold back Qs for fear of looking the fool. That's foolish, ask away

It's a problem that I personally suffer from and regularly battle against.


Holding back questions also has the potential to set a bad example for new employees.  A

There is nothing wrong with asking questions whose answers may end up making you look a bit foolish.  

I'd much rather look the fool than be ignorant.
