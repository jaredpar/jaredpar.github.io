- Don't tell me to add a copyright, just add it. 
- Don't tell me to put a space between `if` and `(`, just put one there.
- Don't tell me to put `{` on a newline, just insert it.

When I think about moing

I think about a better StyleCop, StyleCop++ if you will.  A tool that doesn't constantly warn me about style violations but instead just makes my code have the correct style.  

These types of corections can be done safely without any reasonable risk of altering the semantic meaning of code.
