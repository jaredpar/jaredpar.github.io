<P>I often delete versioned files from Visual Studio without great care for the source control impact.&nbsp; However I eventually have to go through and clean up the mess I made by not properly deleting the files from svn as well as on disk.&nbsp; When you delete a file physically but not in SVN, SVN willl declare the file missing.&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp;For a couple of files a quick "svn delete foo.txt" will take care of the problem.&nbsp; When there are lots of files this is tedious and prone to error.&nbsp; That is, unless you have powershell.</P>
<P># Used to do a "svn delete" on all missing files<BR>function SvnRemoveMissing()<BR>{<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $data = &amp; svn status<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foreach ( $entry in $data )<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if ( $entry -match "^!\s+(.*)$" )<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; svn delete $($matches[1])<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<BR>}<BR></P><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>
