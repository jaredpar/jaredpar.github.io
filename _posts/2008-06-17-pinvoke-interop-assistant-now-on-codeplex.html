<p>I'm happy to announce that the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jaredpar/archive/2008/03/14/making-pinvoke-easy.aspx.">PInvoke Interop Assistant</a> tool is now available on CodePlex.&#160; This includes the binaries, source code and the dev authored unit tests.&#160; </p>  <p>It is hosted on the more general CLR Interop Tools page.&#160; </p>  <p><a title="http://www.codeplex.com/clrinterop" href="http://www.codeplex.com/clrinterop">http://www.codeplex.com/clrinterop</a></p>  <p>I will be actively maintaining this tool in the future and (hopefully) adding more features.&#160; There were several features we cut just before release due to QA costing that I would like to add back (including VS integration, wrapper functions).&#160;&#160; </p>  <p>Please post any suggestions you have for the tool on the site and we will definitely consider them. </p></div>
