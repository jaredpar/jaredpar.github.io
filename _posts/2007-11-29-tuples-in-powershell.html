<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple">Tuples</a> in computer science are usually light weight record objects with simple name value pairs.&nbsp; In scripting languages it is very handy to create them on the fly.&nbsp; For quite some time I was using associative arrays in PowerShell to do just that.&nbsp; </p> <p>PS&gt;$a = @{Name="MyName";Value="MyValue"}</p> <p>It has essentially everything you would need from a tuple inside of a scripting language.&nbsp; The more and more I use PowerShell though I've found that this is not always a good idea.&nbsp; It comes back to PowerShell pipelining.&nbsp; Whenever you pass a collection to a pipeline PowerShell will unroll the collection and pass the individual items.&nbsp; </p> <p>Under the hood, an associative array is a System.Hashtable.&nbsp; As a result it is a collection of name value pairs.&nbsp; Hence when you pass this tuple through a pipeline, it is torn apart and each element of the tuple is passed as a separate object.&nbsp; </p><pre><font size="2">PS&gt;$a = @{Name1="Value1";Name2="Value2"}
PS&gt;$a

Name                           Value
----                           -----
Name2                          Value2
Name1                          Value1</font>
</pre>
<p>Hence I've now taken a new route.&nbsp; Create an actual tuple :)</p>
<p>function New-Tuple()<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; param ( [object[]]$list= $(throw "Please specify the list of names and values") ) 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $tuple = new-object psobject<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for ( $i= 0 ; $i -lt $list.Length; $i = $i+2)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $name = [string]($list[$i])<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $value = $list[$i+1]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $tuple | add-member NoteProperty $name $value<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return $tuple<br>} 
<p>PS&gt;$a = New Tuple Name,1,Value,2
<p>The result can now be passed around pipelines as a single entity.
