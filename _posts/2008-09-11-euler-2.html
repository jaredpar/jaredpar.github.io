<p>Problem #2 came quite a bit faster. The yield syntax in F# is very similar to the C# iterator syntax and made translating this sample a breeze.&#160; </p>  <p>As a commenter posted, in problem #1, I would've been better served to use Seq.filter as opposed to Seq.choose for the purpose of filtering list.&#160; I've applied that here.&#160; One downfall of learning a new language is finding the right API.&#160; I spent a bit of time reading through the Seq documentation looking for the equivalent of the Where extension method and could only find chose.&#160; Lesson learned</p>  <p>// Find the sum of all the even-valued terms in the sequence which do not exceed four million.    <br />let problem2() =     <br />&#160;&#160;&#160; let rec fib prev cur = seq {     <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; yield prev     <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; if cur &lt; 4000000 then     <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; yield! fib cur (prev+cur)     <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; }     <br />&#160;&#160;&#160; fib 1 2     <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; |&gt; Seq.filter (fun x -&gt; 0 = x % 2)     <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; |&gt; Seq.sum</p></div>
