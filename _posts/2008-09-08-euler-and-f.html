<p>I've been looking for some new problems to work on in F# to get more comfortable with the language.&#160; I've been rather slack of late because of other projects but I had a little bit of time this week.&#160; I decided it would be fun to join the crowd and play away at the problems on the <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">project euler</a> site.&#160; That being said, answer #1.</p>  <pre class="code"><span style="color: blue">module </span>Euler =
