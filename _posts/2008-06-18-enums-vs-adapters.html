<p>I like Enums and use them frequently for options and behavior.&#160; To an extent I use Enum's to control behavior.&#160; For example</p>  <pre class="code"><span style="color: blue">enum </span><span style="color: #2b91af">Kind </span>{
    Kind1,
    Kind2,
    Kind3
}

<span style="color: blue">class </span><span style="color: #2b91af">Example </span>{
    <span style="color: blue">private </span><span style="color: #2b91af">Kind </span>m_kind;

    <span style="color: blue">public int </span>SomeAction() {
        <span style="color: blue">switch </span>(m_kind1) {
            <span style="color: blue">case </span><span style="color: #2b91af">Kind</span>.Kind1:
                <span style="color: blue">return </span>ActionForKind1();
            <span style="color: blue">case </span><span style="color: #2b91af">Kind</span>.Kind2:
                <span style="color: blue">return </span>ActionForKind2();
            <span style="color: blue">case </span><span style="color: #2b91af">Kind</span>.Kind3:
                <span style="color: blue">return </span>ActionForKind3();
            <span style="color: blue">default</span>:
                <span style="color: blue">throw new </span><span style="color: #2b91af">InvalidOperationException</span>(<span style="color: #a31515">&quot;Invalid Kind&quot;</span>);
        }
    }
}</pre>

<p>This is an acceptable pattern and use for enums.&#160; However if you take a step back, what I've actually done here is use an enum to implement an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern">adapter pattern</a>.&#160; I've just been a bit lazy about it and not actually coded up the classes.&#160; </p>

<p>To an extent though this violates the principle of single use as Example now performs N different behaviors based upon the enum.&#160; But lets face it, if ActionForKindN() is just a simple 2 line function then is it really worth it to create and maintain an adapter pattern?&#160; A purest would likely say yes but I'm more pragmatic and don't believe so.&#160; </p>

<p>Once the functions reach a certain level of complexity though an adapter pattern is much more suitable.&#160; Over time I find that many of my similar patterns evolve to level.&#160; </p>

<p>Yet I struggle to define the point at which an adapter is suitable.&#160; After several recent experiences I started adapting the following rules.&#160; If any of them is violated then I switch from an enum based behavior to adapter based behavior. </p>

<ol>
  <li>The Action* method contains state</li>

  <li>There are more than 2 functions which change their behavior based on the enum value</li>

  <li>All methods in the class change their behavior based on the enum </li>
</ol>

<p>Anyone have a better set?</p></div>
