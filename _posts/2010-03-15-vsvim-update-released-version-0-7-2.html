<p>I just released an update to VsVim for Visual Studio 2010 RC.&#160; This should be available shortly from the extension manager in Visual Studio or it can be downloaded directly at the following link</p>  <p>Link: <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329">http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329</a></p>  <p><strong>New Features</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Key mapping: map, remap, noremap and there many variations are now supported</li>    <li>Reading vimrc&#160; files on startup</li>    <li>A FAQ: <a href="http://wiki.github.com/jaredpar/VsVim/faq">http://wiki.github.com/jaredpar/VsVim/faq</a></li> </ul>  <p><strong>Future Plans</strong></p>  <p>Originally I planned on moving straight from 0.7.0 to 0.8.0.&#160; However shortly after Visual Studio 2010 RC was released I saw a significant update in number of users for VsVim.&#160; With the new users came many new issues and feature requests.&#160; Several of the requests made, such as key remapping, were blocking issues for users.&#160; As such I decided to prioritize them over getting flashy new features into the project.&#160; </p>  <p>Going forward I intend to leave the 0.7.X branch as the way of unblocking users and to have 0.8.0 be the release for new value add features which arenâ€™t necessarily blocking users (such as the . operator and a proper margin instead of using the status bar).&#160; I hope with this release I can unblock the majority of users and focus on getting 0.8.0 out the door.&#160; But I will release a 0.7.3 if there is further need for unblocking users. </p>  <p>Thanks to everyone who took the time to notify me about issues either by filing bugs on GitHub or sending me an email!&#160; </p>  <p><strong>Other Notes</strong></p>  <p>VsVim is now fully available on GitHub!&#160; </p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim">http://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim</a></li> </ul>  <p>In addition to source code control I am using GitHub for both <a href="http://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim/issues">Bug Tracking</a> and a <a href="http://wiki.github.com/jaredpar/VsVim/faq">FAQ</a>.&#160; Bug tracking is open to the public so please file any issues or feature requests there.&#160; </p>  <p><strong>The usual caveats and expectations</strong></p>  <p>This extension is being released by me, not by Microsoft.&#160; As such the support level for this extension is equivalent to the amount of free time I have to put into it.</p>  <p>Source for this release is available on the GitHub project site.&#160; It and the associated binaries are released under the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc707818.aspx">MS-PL</a>.&#160; </p></div>
