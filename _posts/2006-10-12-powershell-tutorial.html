<P>PowerShell is an exciting product coming out of Microsoft.&nbsp; It's a shell technology many old *nix junkies will find refreshing and very intuitive.&nbsp; It's based on .Net and has a syntax feels like a mix between Pearl, C# and VB.&nbsp; I've blogged about it before but due to several extraneous factors I stopped using it for awhile.</P>
<P>I've recently started using it again while trying to reintruduce myself I ran accross the following tutorial.&nbsp; It appears to be written on a version of PowerShell shortly before it was renamed from it's code name Monad.&nbsp; The syntax is slightly off in a place or two but it's a great introducion to powershell none-the-less.</P>
