<p>I had a little bit of time this weekend to download the F# CTP.&#160; The IDE portion of the CTP is a huge improvement over the previous CTP.&#160; In particular the intellisense engine feels much more smooth, is available in new places and has much better results.&#160; Project engine also has better integration.&#160; Debugging support is much better.&#160; </p>  <p>Overall the IDE now really feels like a ... well IDE.&#160; I felt like the previous CTP was forced into Visual Studio and had much more in common with the old C++ IDE than VB and C#.&#160; This time around the IDE is just more smooth and more closely resembles other managed integrations.&#160; Definately worth the upgrade.</p></div>
