<P>We've heard feedback from several customers regarding the way certain types are displayed in the Debugger.&nbsp; Many of the displays exist to maintain the user experience between versions of Visual Studio.&nbsp; We constantly evaluate if this is the correct choice for a given version of the product.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Starting with VS2008, you don't have to wait for us any longer.&nbsp; In VS2008, VB added full support for many of the debugging features it lacked compared to C# in 2005.&nbsp; In particular we've added full support for the <A href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.debuggerdisplayattribute.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.debuggerdisplayattribute.aspx">DebuggerDisplayAttribute</A>.&nbsp; </P>
<P>By attributing a class or member with this attribute you can control how it is displayed in the debugger.&nbsp; For each column (name, value and type) you can provide an alternate string or expression to display.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The best part about this attribute is you can target types that exist in different libraries.&nbsp; You don't even need the source for them.&nbsp; One of the members in the Type field which species the target type.&nbsp; Customizing a type in a separate library requires slightly more work than customizing a type you have the source for.&nbsp; For a source project you can just apply the attribute directly to the type or member and it will display.&nbsp; For a type in another library you need to do the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Define a class library and include all of the <A href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.debuggerdisplayattribute.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.debuggerdisplayattribute.aspx">DebuggerDisplayAttribute</A> you want.&nbsp; Make sure to apply the attributes to the assembly and specify the <A href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.debuggerdisplayattribute.type.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.debuggerdisplayattribute.type.aspx">Type</A> member.&nbsp; Ex.</LI></UL>

<UL>
<LI>Place the built library under the folder "Visual Studio 2008\Visualizers" which is under your my documents folder.&nbsp; </LI></UL>
<P>After doing this any Guid type will now show up as the actual Guid String ("10f3c4eb-7c0f-41b1-ae83-8838ff2f4f70") instead of {System.Guid} </P></div>
