<P>I'm a <STRONG>huge</STRONG> fan of the LUA support in Vista.&nbsp; It has it's quirks but it's a major step forward for Windows programming.&nbsp; As a former *nix guy I've had to run LUA the hard way before Vista.&nbsp; The support in Vista is tons better than it used to be.&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp;There are a few areas that are still not optimal.&nbsp; One of them that's been bugging me lately are legacy MSI installers.&nbsp; Vista almost always correctly elevates and offers to run the installer as Admin.&nbsp; </P>
<P>This causes a small problem though with some legacy MSI's.&nbsp; A lot of MSI have a check box at the end of the MSI setup with text similar to "Launch SuchAndSuch Program Now".&nbsp; The problem is who the program launches as.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>Prior to Vista there was no auto-priviledge elevation.&nbsp; So most people ran MSI's as there normal user account which was an admin.&nbsp; Launching the process at the end of the MSI was just fine.</P>
<P>Now in Vista most people run as a normal user and MSI's elevated.&nbsp; So this feature will now, on legacy MSI's, launch the program as an Administrator rather than your normal user account.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Without the help of a tool, there's no good way to detect when this happens.&nbsp; To be safe, I always un check that box and manually start the app so I know it will be running under my normal account.</P><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>
