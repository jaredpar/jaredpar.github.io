<p>I finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Facts-Fallacies-Software-Engineering-Development/dp/0321117425">Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering</a> a few weeks ago.&#160; This is an excellent book and I recommend it for anyone who's been in the industry for a few years.&#160; </p>  <p>Typically I don't enjoy books of this type because I feel they are too preachy, written by people who aren't on the front lines and don't understand the day to day problems a programmer will face or are just too long winded.&#160; Neither appears to be the case here.&#160; </p>  <p>Mr Glass takes a very interesting approach to this book.&#160; In addition to listing good resources for every fact/fallacy he also offers a small (albeit less detailed) section on why people disbelieve in this particular item.&#160; </p>  <p>Top 3 facts which I think have the most value in my job</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>Fact 36: Programmer-created, built-in debug code is an important supplement to testing tools. </strong>The majority of bugs filed against code I own are not because of an invalid behavior.&#160; It's much more likely that QA will hit an ASSERT I added to the code base which fire before the behavior difference.&#160; What's encouraging is QA will often note: If I ignore the assert everything seems to work alright.&#160; Without a dev assert these bugs would have gone unnoticed until a much bigger problem hit.&#160; </li>    <li><strong>Fact 43: Maintenance is a solution not a problem. </strong> Except for the end of a cycle, I constantly do maintenance work to parts of the code base.&#160; If it's broken, doesn't meet standards, uses bad resource management, etc fix it!&#160; Don't wait for the bug.&#160; </li>    <li><strong>Fact 49: Errors tend to cluster. </strong> Good QA members know this and actively exploit it.&#160; Unfortunately it affects my job since I'm on the receiving end :)</li> </ul>  <p>Top 3 facts which I think more people need to take to heart</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>Fact 6: New tools and techniques cause an initial loss of productivity/quality. </strong>Anyone who reads my blog knows that I am a huge tool guy (see the PowerShell tag).&#160; Tools come with a cost though.&#160; As productive as PowerShell and my other bag of tools make me they all came with a price tag.&#160; One that has been paid over many times but the initial ramp up did cost time.&#160; </li>    <li><strong>Fact 19: Modification of re-used code is particularly error prone.&#160; </strong>In my experience the costs of this are typically underestimated.&#160; Mainly because the behavior depended on is not well understood.</li>    <li><strong>Fact 38: Rigorous inspections should not replace testing.&#160; </strong>I heard an engineer say it best on the history channel &quot;One test is worth one thousand expert opinions.&quot;&#160; Inspections mean nothing if they are not backed up by tests.&#160; Even if the inspectors get it right, without a regression test there is no way to guarantee it will stay that way for the future. </li> </ul>  <p>Top 3 facts which most surprised me</p>  <ol>   <li><strong>Fact 3: Adding people to a late project makes it later</strong>.&#160; I heard this long before I read the book but I wanted to call it out because I remember just how surprised I was the first time I heard it.</li>    <li><strong>Fact 25: Missing requirements are the hardest requirement errors to fix.&#160; </strong>Falls into the category of &quot;haven't thought about that one but makes sense.&quot;&#160; </li>    <li><strong>Fact 30: COBOL is a very bad language, but all the others (for business applications) are so much worse</strong>.&#160; This stems more than anything else from my complete lack of knowledge about COBOL.&#160; It's an often scorned language yet if it was so bad no one used it then no one would complain. </li> </ol>  <p>Citation: </p>  <p>Glass, Robert L.&#160; Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering.
