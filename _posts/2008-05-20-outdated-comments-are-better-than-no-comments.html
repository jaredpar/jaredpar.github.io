<p>While investigating our locking infrastructure a few days ago I ran across an odd comment.&#160; I was looking at a particular usage of a lock and the comment said that &quot;Using lock type X because we must pump messages here.&quot;&#160; Contrarily the lock type being used most definitely did not allow message pumping.&#160; </p>  <p>After a quick history search on the code base I was able to track down the developer responsible for the discrepancy.&#160; He merely forgot to update the comment when making the change.&#160; However he was able to explain the history behind the comment and the switching of the locking type.&#160; </p>  <p>I've heard people argue in the past that they didn't comment code because comments get out of date and lead developers in the wrong direction.&#160; They might do it correctly but they didn't trust the next guy.&#160; Then the comment would be wrong and useless for the next developer.</p>  <p>I think this is a example of why that mentality is wrong. </p>  <ol>   <li>Even though it was currently wrong it was historically accurate</li>    <li>The commented add good insight into the choice of locking mechanism</li>    <li>It added a bit of detail into the historical architecture of the code base.</li>    <li>It was a heck of a lot better than staring at a comment-less field that appeared to exist for no reason.</li> </ol>  <p>I'm not arguing that comments which are flat out wrong at the time they are authored are a valuable resource.&#160; Yet not commenting because you don't &quot;trust&quot; the next guy is equally wrong. </p></div>
