<p>I just released an update to VsVim for Visual Studio 2010.&nbsp; This is available on the extension manager in Visual Studio or can be downloaded directly at the following link.</p>

<p>This is fairly major release from the last announced (0.8.2) which includes the following changes</p>
<ul>
<li>Essentially a rewrite of Visual Mode</li>
<li>New motions f, F, t, T, e, [, [[, ], ]], (, ), {, } </li>
<li>Visual Studio integration improvements</li>
<li>Memory leak fixes</li>
<li>Fixes for international keyboard issues </li>
<li>And of course many bug fixes </li>
</ul>
<p>I do want to take a second and thank two VsVim users, <a href="http://github.com/pedrosal">pedrosal</a> and <a href="http://github.com/tuncbah">tuncbah</a>, for reporting several international keyboard issues, helping me to understand the problem and testing out my fixes.&nbsp; They were particularly nasty issues that caused me a bit of trouble.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Future Plans</strong></p>
<p>We&rsquo;re quickly approaching a 1.0.0 release.&nbsp; My initial goal for 1.0.0 was to have a largely functional Vim emulation layer on top of Visual Studio.&nbsp; With the following features currently in progress I think VsVim will be well within that goal</p>
<ul>
<li>Vim style regex support &ndash; right now all regex&rsquo;s are done with vanilla BCL regex&rsquo;s </li>
<li>Clipboard support </li>
<li>Improvements to the . operator </li>
</ul>
<p>This work is well under way and I hope to complete it within the next month or so.&nbsp; Releasing 1.0 will be a huge milestone for us but will by no means be the end of the work.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>The usual caveats and expectations</strong></p>
<p>This extension is being released by me, not by Microsoft.&nbsp; As such the support level for this extension is equivalent to the amount of free time I have to put into it.</p>
<p>Source for this release is available on the <a href="http://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim">GitHub project site</a>.&nbsp; It and the associated binaries are released under the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc707818.aspx">MS-PL</a>.</p><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>
