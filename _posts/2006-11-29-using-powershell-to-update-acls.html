<P>I've been an avid fan of running as a limited user account (LUA) for almost all of my computing career.&nbsp; It's in large part a holdover from my *NIX days but it's an important practice for Windows as well.&nbsp;I'm very excited about this being the default for Windows going forward starting with Vista.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The bad news is that not everyone is quite LUA compliant yet.&nbsp; This hits me hardest with PowerShell when I'm trying to run some auto update scripts that change the Registry.&nbsp; There are a lot of programs I use that still store their settings in HKLM or the likes.&nbsp; So I've added a PowerShell script that will grant me access to those keys as an LUA.&nbsp; It was written a long time ago so it doesn't utilize the get/set-acl commandlets but it runs just the same. </P><PRE># Give the user access to the registry entry
