Determine if a command exists in your path.  Very helpful when you are writing scripts for mulptiple machines.

    $local:cmd = get-command doesnotexist -ea SilentlyContinue
    if ( $null -eq $cmd )
    {
      # Action if command does not exist
    }
    else
    {
      # Action if command exists
    }

This will get the directory holding the currently executing script

    $local:scriptPath = [System.IO.Path]::GetDirectoryName($MyInvocation.MyCommand.Definition)
