<P>.Net 2.0 Added a lot in the way of allowing programmers to easily interact with Windows.&nbsp; One of the best additions is the Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents class.&nbsp; It holds events for a lot of system relatied events (hence the name).&nbsp; </P>
<P>A common scenario I see on the forums is users wanting to respond to a system shutown event.&nbsp; The easiest way to access this from managed code is the Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents.SessionEnding event.&nbsp; This is not exactly the shutdown event because it actually represents the user session that the program is running in.&nbsp; A session is created when you log into the system and is destroyed when you log off or shutdown the computer (which eventually forces a logoff :) ).</P>
<P>The arguments provide two pieces of useful information.&nbsp; The first being the reason for the session ending (logoff or shutdown).&nbsp; It also allows you to cancel the event via the Cancel property.&nbsp; For example the following code will prevent the shutdown of the computer as long as the program is running.</P><PRE>Imports Microsoft.Win32

Sub PreventShutdown()
  AddHandler SystemEvents.SessionEnding AddressOf PreventShutdownHelper
End Sub

Sub PreventShutdownHelper(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal args As SessionEndingEventArgs)
  If args.Reason = SessionEndReasons.Shutdown Then
    args.Cancel = True
  End If
End Sub
</PRE>
<P>While this will prevent the shutdown from occurring you will see many of the apps on your screen close.&nbsp; That's because some of them get the shutdown event before your app and most will close as a result.&nbsp;</P>
<P>There are a couple of caveats that come with using this event. </P>
<OL>
<LI>If you're using a WinForm app, there is no gaurantee you will get this event before your application raises the Close event.&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>This event won't ever fire (without a lot of trickery) from a Console application.</LI>
<LI>Setting Cancel to True will usually work but not always.&nbsp; </LI></OL>
<P>That aside, if you just need to save some data and or do some quick book keeping before exiting this will do the trick. </P><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>
