<p>One of the parts of a Tuple implementation for <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/RantPack">RantPack</a> I struggled the most with was naming.&#160; I tend to struggle with names quite a bit and there's really no reason for it.&#160; It's a combination of pickiness and ... well there's really no good reason.&#160; Pieces which can bother me range from </p>  <ol>   <li>Don't like the way it types.&#160; If I can't type something easily it drives me nuts and I secretly desire to change it to a word that is easier to type.&#160; I have sadly spent a large amount of time on <a href="http://www.thesaurus.com">www.thesaurus.com</a> looking for better words to type.</li>    <li>Looks funny.&#160; No real solid criteria here, just what I don't like.&#160; Words sometimes look good the first time you type them but over time lose their appeal</li>    <li>Doesn't match conventions.&#160; Ah, now we're onto solid reasons.&#160; Names should match conventions.</li>    <li>Name is ambiguous.&#160; If the name doesn't give a clear intention of the operation I do my best to change it.&#160; </li>    <li>FxCop violation.&#160; This bothers me less than others but if FxCop doesn't like it I think a bit harder about naming it. </li> </ol>  <p>Now comes Tuples.&#160; Many implementations of tuples don't even have names but instead rely on language constructs such as pattern matching to access the values.&#160; That's not really the DotNet way of doing things though so I chose to give Tuple values names.&#160; </p>  <p>Originally I chose A for item 0, B for item 1, etc ...&#160; This made sense at the time because it kept the syntax short.&#160; However I've grown to dislike this naming convention.&#160; Primarily because it violates #3 and #4 above.&#160; While A-E is perfectly clear for me I've talked with others who this confuses.&#160; </p>  <p>In addition, to keep the nameless syntax option I provided an indexer property.&#160; So values are available with a 0 based index.&#160; Since several languages expose this with the name &quot;Item&quot;, there are now really two names for a value.&#160; For example the first value is both tuple.A and tuple.Item[0].&#160; </p>  <p>After some thought I decided to name the values Item0-&gt;Item4 depending on the size of the tuple.&#160; </p></div>
