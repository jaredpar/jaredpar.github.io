<p>Unfortunately when creating Live Search, the live team did not use a term which could easily be converted to a verb (i.e. google and google-ing).&#160; The term &quot;live searching&quot; doesn't really flow well in a hallway conversation nearly as well as google-ing.&#160; </p>  <ul>   <li>I live searched that movie John was talking about ... </li> </ul>  <p>I considered for awhile just using the &quot;googling&quot; term for both using live search and google.&#160; But this wouldn't allow me to quickly correlate the goods and bads of each search engine.&#160; I needed a new term.&#160; </p>  <p>Thus learching was born:&#160; It's short for &quot;Live sEARCHing&quot;.&#160; When pronouncing it should rhyme with &quot;searching.&quot;</p>  <p>Anyone else with a better term?</p></div>
