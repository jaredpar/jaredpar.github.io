<p>The title of this post essentially says it all.&#160; AutoSize and DockStyle.Fill don't mix well together.&#160; Both properties exist to describe the size relationship relative to the rest of the control but they do so in conflicting ways.</p>  <p>AutoSize is a property describing the size of a control relative to it's contents.&#160; Setting this to True will generally cause a control to resize itself so that it takes up only enough room to display it's contents.&#160; </p>  <p>DockStyle.Fill is a property describing the size of a control relative to the size of it's container.&#160; A control will resize to fit all of the empty space in it's parent container with this property set. </p>  <p>In effect these properties represent opposite ways of describing size.&#160; Most controls will prevent you from setting conflicting settings in the designer.&#160; However it's difficult to prevent you from setting conflicting settings between a container and it's contents.</p>  <p>For instance, one combination is the following.&#160; This may seem a little odd at first.&#160; It commonly happens when you are trying to embed a non-autosizing control inside a Container that supports AutoSize.&#160; For instance if you are trying to place a TextBox inside of a FlowLayoutPanel</p>  <ul>   <li>Container</li>    <ul>     <li>AutoSize = true</li>      <li>AutoSizeMode = GrowAndShrink</li>   </ul>    <li>Containee</li>    <ul>     <li>Dock = DockStyle.Fill</li>   </ul> </ul>  <p>If you try this code it will often cause the Container Control to shrink to nothing.&#160; Why?&#160; In affect both controls are asking each other how big they should be and with no one having the deciding factor they agree on ... nothing. </p>  <p>Instead for this scenario you should leave the Containee to DockStyle.None and manually set the size.&#160; </p></div>
