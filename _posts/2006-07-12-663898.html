<P>After working a little over 2 years with the VSTS Architect SKU I've decide to take on a new role at Microsoft.&nbsp; I am taking a job with the Visual Basic Core Compiler team.&nbsp; This is an exciting oppuritunity for me to get back to a lot of the topics I worked with in college.&nbsp; Expect me to be showing up with more regularity on VB newsgroups and forums.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The transition occurred just over a month ago but I've been too busy to put an announcement on my blog until now.&nbsp; </P><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>
