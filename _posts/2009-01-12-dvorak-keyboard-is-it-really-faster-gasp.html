<P>Most people discover I’m a Dvorak user because they’re in my office, attempt to drive during a conversation and find they are typing gibberish.&nbsp; I take the keyboard, hit CTRL+LEFT_SHIFT and they’re on their way again.&nbsp; Well at least until they open up a new window.&nbsp; It usually leads to a conversation about how I like Dvorak.&nbsp; And most importantly … “is it really faster than QWERTY?”&nbsp; </P>
<P>I’ve been using a <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard">Dvorak keyboard</A> for 4 years now.&nbsp; If you’re not familiar with Dvorak, it’s an alternative keyboard layout designed to be better in QWERTY in both efficiency and speed back in 1936.&nbsp; Other benefits are also associated with it such as ergonomics, reduced typos, etc.&nbsp; In my experience I find developers are much more keenly interested in the speed part.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Over 70 years later there is still a bit of debate if it achieved these goals.&nbsp; There are several studies of greater and lesser quality on the subject.&nbsp; None of which really has seemed to end the debate.&nbsp; If you are curious about the actual studies I encourage you to start at the <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard">wikipedia page</A>.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Before I switched to Dvorak I read a few of the studies.&nbsp; In the end I’m not sure of their respective quality level but it didn’t stop me from trying out Dvorak anyways.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; As I said there appeared to be a lot of debate, typing faster sounded nice and my former college roommate convinced me it was a great idea.&nbsp;&nbsp; The last reason being the most important.</P>
<P>What I didn’t see a lot of though when I was reading up on it was how the Dvorak keyboard affects the life of a developer (at least outside the speed thing).&nbsp; The studies were geared toward more general problems.&nbsp; </P>
<P>So this post is about how I feel the layout affects me as a developer 4 years later.&nbsp; Note the word <STRONG>feel</STRONG>.&nbsp; If you are looking for a hard core scientific study, I would navigate elsewhere.&nbsp; This is about my personal experiences as a developer with learning Dvorak and using it in my daily routine.&nbsp; So please read this post as an opinion piece and not a statement of fact.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG>Is it faster?</STRONG></P>
<P>While I was reading up on Dvorak but still typing QWERTY I started timing myself with several programs.&nbsp; In particular I measured peak WPM and average WPM.&nbsp; Two weeks later I started with Dvorak and kept timing myself for about the next six months.&nbsp; </P>
<P>In terms of peak WPM Dvorak is definitely faster for me.&nbsp; I could get a steady peak at 120 WPM on QWERTY but can get into 140 with Dvorak.&nbsp; </P>
<P>For my normal day to day typing, I do type faster but not appreciably so.&nbsp; Maybe 5 WPM.&nbsp; I can easily hit and maintain 70-80 WPM for day to day tasks and once you’re at that speed, much more isn’t really noticed when you’re coding.&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG>How long did it take to switch?</STRONG></P>
<P>The first month was mostly me trying to work in Dvorak but getting so frustrated that I switched back to QWERTY to get real work done.&nbsp; After the first month I spent the majority of my time in Dvorak.&nbsp; I was noticeably slower in replying to email and occasionally I would switch back to QWERTY to fire off a longer email or code snippet.&nbsp; The third month was the turning point.&nbsp; I hit full time Dvorak and stopped switching to QWERTY except for cases where someone else was in my office.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I kept using typing tests continually check on how my overall speed was doing.&nbsp; Around the end of the third month I pretty much hit parity with my QWERTY abilities.&nbsp; After six months I did see a small increase in my average WPM and I hit 140 WPM several times.&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG>Is it more ergonomic?</STRONG></P>
<P>Before I started using Dvorak I was getting a bit of CTS in my right shoulder.&nbsp; Enough so that I started looking into exercises to help it out.&nbsp; The symptoms started to go away fairly soon after I started using Dvorak as my full time layout.</P>
<P>Now I am <STRONG>not</STRONG> actually making a claim that it’s more ergonomic.&nbsp; For me in my situation it helped.&nbsp; IMHO, I think it’s just as likely that a simple change of pace had as much to do with it as the actual layout.&nbsp; But if you’re desperate and you have time to kill … </P>
<P><STRONG>Are any of the key repositioning impactful for development?</STRONG></P>
<P>Yes.&nbsp; The repositioning of the {},[] and = keys is brutal for a developer in a C based language.&nbsp; Essentially anything in the top right corner of the QWERTY keyboard.&nbsp; They keys are in almost the same position.&nbsp; This made the switch even harder as muscle memory kept taking over and spitting jibberish into my code.&nbsp; </P>
<P>This will make life difficult for the first month or so.</P>
<P><STRONG>What weird issues did I encounter?</STRONG></P>
<P>I think the biggest issue is I’m a VIM user.&nbsp; For some reason I thought it a bright idea to not do any special VIM mapping and learn to use the standard VIM key mappings with Dvorak.&nbsp; That was … a learning experience.&nbsp; It took quite some time before it turned back into muscle memory.&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG>Can you still type QWERTY?</STRONG></P>
<P>Somewhat.&nbsp; It takes me about 5 minutes to get going but after that I can touch type to a degree.&nbsp; Albeit pretty slowly.&nbsp; Enough though that I can use a machine for a few hours and debug a problem.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Using very cryptic command line programs such as WinDbg, PowerShell or VIM on QWERTY is very painful.&nbsp; It’s amazing how much of that is just muscle memory.&nbsp; Even if I get into QWERTY touch type mode I have to think very hard about what I’m typing in those types of programs.&nbsp; I flat out can’t use VIM but the rest I get by after a bit of frustration.&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG>Do you make less typos?</STRONG></P>
<P>That sound you heard was the rest of my coworkers and my wife laughing hysterically.&nbsp; </P>
<P>One of the benefits I read about when I switched to Dvorak is that it would reduce typos and misspellings.&nbsp; I’ll sum that claim up with a quick “Didn’t wrok for me”.&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG>Passwords</STRONG></P>
<P>Eventually, you will encounter a situation that forces you to type your password in QWERTY.&nbsp; Prior to QWERTY when choosing a new password, I would stare at my keyboard and type in gibberish for a new password.&nbsp; Well not exactly gibberish, it had to have a certain count of numbers, symbols, letters and a minimum length.&nbsp; But I would take 5 minutes and just learn the gibberish via muscle memory.</P>
<P>This is not so great when you need to type in a&nbsp;passworld via QWERTY.&nbsp; Muscle memory doesn't quite translate back to the QWERTY binding.&nbsp;&nbsp;To the people sitting in the room with me I'm sure it was fairly humerous.&nbsp; I would type a few letters into the password box, then mouse to&nbsp;the desktop, type quickly, see where my fingers ended up, and then type the next few letters of the password.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The lesson is, make sure you know what your password is, and not just where to move your fingers.</P>
<P><STRONG>Do I think that developers should switch to Dvorak?</STRONG></P>
<P>For 95% of the developers out there I would say no.&nbsp; The gains are minor if any.&nbsp; Outside of WPM the gains are subjective.&nbsp; Developers really seem intent on the speed portion of the switch.&nbsp; This speed gain was minor for me.&nbsp; Once you can steady type ~70WPM the gain really doesn’t seem worth it for programming.&nbsp; But more importantly though, being faster won’t make you a better programmer, practice will. </P>
<P>Additionally, besides the learning curve of getting to Dvorak, you have to retain some level of competence at QWERTY.&nbsp; Whether it’s debugging problems on other peoples machines, or participating in a group presentation you will be using QWERTY more often than you think.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>But there are that 5% who are </P>
<OL>
<LI>Looking for a challenge </LI>
<LI>Want to try something different </LI>
<LI>Or simply just want other people to stop using your computer </LI></OL>
<P>Even if you do stick it out though, the benefits are small and many are very subjective. </P>
<P><STRONG>EDIT:</STRONG> Forgot the problems I had with passwords</P></div>
