<p>Spent about an hour debugging a bit of code today.&#160; I was attempting to read data from a particular source and kept getting back failure codes.&#160; After some debugging I discovered the data didn't actually exist in the source I was reading from.&#160; </p>  <p>This put me back to investigating where I wrote the data out.&#160; Restarted the scenario and verified that I actually called the data writing API and that it succeeded.&#160; </p>  <p>Now what?&#160; Well the data clearly wasn't there so I concluded the data writing must be failing in some odd way.&#160; I eventually found the data writing code and was horrified to find the following definition.</p>  <pre>HRESULT WriteSomeData(...) {
  // We don't support data of this type
  return S_OK;
}</pre>

<p>Personally I thought this warranted an error code (perhaps E_NOTIMPL).&#160; But given the situation I must conclude the author successfully failed to write the data.</p></div>
