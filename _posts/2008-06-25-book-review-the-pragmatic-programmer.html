<p>Finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1213506306&amp;sr=8-1">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> a few weeks ago.&#160; I've been slacking off on the book review but better late than never.&#160; </p>  <p>This is a good book for people desiring to be a more pragmatic programmer.&#160; At ~270 pages it's a quick read and loaded with content.&#160;&#160; This book has several predominant themes </p>  <ol>   <li>Personal responsibility in programming</li>    <li>Pragmatic approaches to problems</li>    <li>Paranoid programming</li> </ol>  <p>My personal favorite has to be #3.&#160; If you don't trust anything, including yourself, you're going to have fewer and fewer unexpected bugs in your code.&#160; </p>  <p>Along those lines is the best chapter in the book: Pragmatic Paranoia.&#160; This chapter details the virtues of design by contract, aggressive use of asserts and the virtues of crashing the instant a problem is discovered.&#160; </p>  <p>The next best chapter in the book, &quot;A pragmatic approach&quot;, deals with the general approach to programming.&#160; You've likely heard these all in pieces before but the authors do a great job of organizing and presenting the material.&#160; </p>  <p>One particular approach new to me is Tracer Bullets.&#160; This is similar to prototyping but with a very different aim.&#160; Prototypes should be used to quickly test out a subset of a bigger solution while ultimately being throw away code.&#160; Trace Bullets are also designed to give a quick solution but also to be the final product.&#160; They focus on getting the basic framework implemented and simple implementations for pieces in order to give the user a working product.&#160; Feedback will create new iterations of the product on the same framework.&#160; </p>  <p>While overall a good book there are some parts that advanced programmers will likely skip over.&#160; They deal with the usage of basic tools of a programmer: debugger, text editor, source code control.&#160; All great suggestion/requirements and reading for newer programmers though. </p>  <p>All in all a good book.&#160; </p>  <p>Citation:</p>  <p>Hunt, Andrew and Thomas, David.
