Another day, another PowerShell feature discovered.?? Unfortunately this time
it was a feature that made me think I had a bug in my script.?? The script read
through some directories, did some file parsing and created a data object for
every directory in the form of a
[Tuple](http://blogs.msdn.com/jaredpar/archive/2007/11/29/tuples-in-
powershell.aspx).

One of the files was People.txt and contained a list of relevant people for
the data (one per line).?? Unfortunately the parameter kept showing up like so
...

People  
\------  
{People.txt, People.txt, People.txt, People.txt}

Confusion set in as to what I did wrong since the code in question amounted to
the following.

D:\temp> new-tuple "People",(gc People.txt)

Next step is manual verification

D:\temp> gc People.txt  
jared  
jamie  
jason  
mary

So far so good.?? Then a tried the explicit tuple code and got back the
People.txt problem.?? Eventually I decided to try out get-member and see
exactly what I had in the array.?? It was a string type as expected but then I
noticed the following ... extra items.

D:\temp> gc People.txt | gm

???? TypeName: System.String

Name???????????????????????? MemberType?????????????????????? Definition  
\----???????????????????????? \----------?????????????????????? \----------  
...

PSParentPath???????? NoteProperty?????????????????? System.String PSParentPath=D:\temp  
PSPath???????????????????? NoteProperty?????????????????? System.String PSPath=D:\temp\People.txt  
PSProvider???????????? NoteProperty
System.Management.Automation.Provider...  
ReadCount?????????????? NoteProperty?????????????????? System.Int64 ReadCount=1  

It turns out that when you read information from a file in PowerShell they
will handily add in the file information as NoteProperty instances.?? All well
and good and I can see where that would be useful but for now it's really
messing up my display.?? To remove it just tell powershell that I really just
want a string.

D:\temp> new-tuple "People",(gc People.txt | %{[string]$_})

People

{jared, jamie, jason, mary}
