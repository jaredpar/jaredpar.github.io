<p>I just released an update to VsVim for Visual Studio 2010 Beta2.&#160; This should be available shortly from the extension manager in Visual Studio or it can be downloaded directly at the following link</p>  <p>Link: <a title="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329" href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329">http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329</a></p>  <p><strong>Changes</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>     <p>Removal of conflicting key bindings</p>      <p>On startup VsVim will now look for any key bindings which conflict with implemented Vim commands. It will then provide a message box allowing you to remove the key bindings for this session of Visual Studio. Right now this is an all or nothing removal, future versions may make this a more granular process</p>   </li>    <li>     <p>Normal Mode no longer intercepts all keystrokes (such as Cut and Paste)</p>      <p>This bug in the previous release was a result of the command routing changes that occured between Beta1 and Beta2. I believe I know have them all worked out and VsVim should only be intercepting commands it intends to process</p>   </li>    <li>New Normal Mode Commands</li>    <ul>     <li>Mark setting: m[a-zA-Z]</li>      <li>Mark Jump: `[a-z], ‘[a-z] </li>      <ul>       <li>This is currently limited to local marks </li>     </ul>      <li>Page Up, Page Down: CTRL-U,CTRL-D</li>      <li>Join: j</li>   </ul> </ul>  <p><strong>What’s Next?</strong></p>  <p>The biggest area I want to focus on for the next release is Command mode and rounding, more normal mode behavior (especially mark support) and basic range support.</p>  <p>At a minimum I want to expand all of the normal mode commands I have implemented to have their corresponding command mode version implemented.&#160; Join, mark, etc …&#160; This shouldn’t be a big work item.&#160; Command mode is just something I’ve been neglecting up to this point in favor of infrastructure.&#160; </p>  <p>The other big item I want to work on is ranges.&#160; Many command mode commands operate on ranges and it’s something I’ve yet to implement at a core level.&#160; The basic mark support I added in this release starts the process but I have a ways to go.&#160; </p>  <p>Also, any suggestions users have are very welcome.&#160; </p>  <p><strong>The usual caveats and expectations</strong></p>  <p>This extension is being released by me, not by Microsoft.&#160; As such the support level for this extension is equivalent to the amount of free time I have to put into it.</p></div>
