It's somewhat frustrating to try and post code to the internet for your blog.  Getting the color scheme right isn't easy if you're like me and don't use a standard color scheme for coding.  I prefer a very dark coding environment (inkpot) and most people don't want to read code in that scheme.

Someone just led me onto a great website that will auto-colorize your code.
