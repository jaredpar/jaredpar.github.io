<p>In addition to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jaredpar/archive/2008/02/13/building-future-t.aspx">Future&lt;T&gt;</a> there is also the concept of Futures that don't return any values.&#160; Instead the perform the operation and return.&#160; Because there is no additional data to pass between the threads building an Empty Future is fairly straight forward.</p>  <p>The biggest decision is how to declare it.&#160; EmptyFuture exposes no new accessible methods or properties above what <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jaredpar/archive/2008/02/12/building-the-base-future.aspx">Future</a> already exposes.&#160; If a class doesn't provide any additional behavior is there any reason to expose it?&#160; In this case I think not.&#160; Therefore it will be declared as a private inner class of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jaredpar/archive/2008/02/12/building-the-base-future.aspx">Future</a>.&#160; </p>  <p>Yes this makes it impossible to directly create from a user perspective.&#160; You could also make a good argument that creation is new behavior and therefore EmptyFuture should be exposed.&#160; However for Future's, as with other generic classes, I prefer static factory methods for creation.&#160; It allows the user to take advantage of type inference as much as possible.</p>  <pre class="code">        <span style="color: rgb(0,0,255)">private</span> <span style="color: rgb(0,0,255)">class</span> <span style="color: rgb(43,145,175)">EmptyFuture</span> : <span style="color: rgb(43,145,175)">Future
