<p>Just had a random thought while I was looking at some code today.&#160; It’s yet another argument in the case sensitive vs. case insensitive language battle.&#160; </p>  <p>Do you really want this to be able to compile?</p>  <pre>class C1 {
  int M1;
  int m1;
}</pre>

<p>Yes it’s an abuse and should absolutely be caught in a code review.&#160; But at the same time, experience has taught me that if an evil thing can be done with a language, someone will do it.</p>

<p>And yes, sadly I’ve seen code like this before.&#160; </p></div>
