<p>This falls into the "learn something new everyday but not necessarily entirely useful bucket".&nbsp; An app I spend a bit of time on leverages the CodeDom heavily to spit out managed code.&nbsp; While running through some test cases the other day I noticed that it was prefixing many identifier names with the @ symbol when the generated code was C#.&nbsp; </p> <p>At first I assumed this was a bug in my code but I noticed that the generated code compiled just fine.&nbsp; A bit of digging through the C# spec turned up the purpose of the @ character. This allows you to use C# keywords as identifiers.&nbsp; For instance you can have "class @class".&nbsp; </p> <p><a title="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa664670(VS.71).aspx" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa664670(VS.71).aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa664670(VS.71).aspx</a></p> <p>VB has the same type of feature but they require the name to be wrapped in [].&nbsp; </p> <p>This still didn't answer the question of why my code generated with this character. It turns out this is a feature of the C# CodeDom.&nbsp; When outputting an identifier, the C# CodeDom will prefix the identifier with @ if one of the following conditions are true. </p> <ol> <li>The identifier is a keyword</li> <li>The identifier is prefixed with two underscores.</li></ol> <p>It turns out the second rule exists to allow flexibility in the C# compiler implementation.&nbsp; All identifiers that are prefixed with two underscores are inherently reserved for the implementation to provide such actions as extended keywords (reference at bottom of above link).</p></div>
