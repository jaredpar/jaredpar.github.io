<p>Recently I was working on a PowerShell script which involved translating byte arrays into strings using the appropriate encoding.&#160; Unfortunately I kept getting the wrong choice for encoding and printed out essentially random data to the console screen.&#160; </p>  <p>Unfortunately random data + windows console screens = beeps, beeps and lots more beeps.&#160; </p>  <p>What's even worse is these beeps queue up.&#160; Almost a full minute after a given encoding mistake I was still paying the price.&#160; Highly annoying.</p>  <p>There is no way to disable the beeps on an individual console level.&#160; But it can be disabled on a system wide level.&#160; Beep is a windows service so it just needs to be stopped</p>  <blockquote>   <p>net stop Beep</p> </blockquote>  <p>This does need to be executed with Admin privileges.&#160; After that I can code beep free.&#160; </p></div>
