Problem #2 came quite a bit faster. The yield syntax in F# is very similar to
the C# iterator syntax and made translating this sample a breeze.

As a commenter posted, in problem #1, I would've been better served to use
Seq.filter as opposed to Seq.choose for the purpose of filtering list. I've
applied that here. One downfall of learning a new language is finding the
right API. I spent a bit of time reading through the Seq documentation
looking for the equivalent of the Where extension method and could only find
chose. Lesson learned

// Find the sum of all the even-valued terms in the sequence which do not
exceed four million.  
let problem2() =  
'' let rec fib prev cur = seq {  
'''''''? yield prev  
'''''''? if cur < 4000000 then  
'''''''''' yield! fib cur (prev+cur)  
''''?? }  
'' fib 1 2  
''''?? |> Seq.filter (fun x -> 0 = x % 2)  
''''?? |> Seq.sum
