<p>I was reading a post on Coding Horror the other day about programming books and how developers <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001108.html">don't read enough of them.</a>&#160; I readily agree with the first two points in the article that 1) most programming books suck and 2) books are sold by weight not by volume.&#160; Reading is an integral part of a developers life.&#160; Blogs are a great source of info but books are a necessity as well.&#160; </p>  <p>In my experience, the hardest language to find a good book for is C++.&#160; Far too many books and far too few which are worth reading.&#160; Here are my favorite which 1) don't suck and 2) don't weigh a ton but have a enormous amount of information.</p>  <ol>   <li>Herb Sutter: </li>    <ol>     <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Exceptional-Engineering-Programming-Solutions-Depth/dp/0201615622">Exceptional C++</a></li>      <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/More-Exceptional-Engineering-Programming-Depth/dp/020170434X/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b/105-5993487-4416400">More Exceptional C++</a></li>      <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Exceptional-C%2B%2B-Style-Engineering-Depth/dp/0201760428/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1209624394&amp;sr=1-3">Exceptional C++ Style</a></li>   </ol>    <li>Scott Meyers</li>    <ol>     <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Template-Metaprogramming-Concepts-Techniques-Depth/dp/0321227255">Effective C++</a></li>      <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/More-Effective-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/020163371X/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b">More Effective C++</a></li>   </ol> </ol>  <p>Others may disagree but I classify the Scott Meyer books as being good for developers looking to break into the intermediate level.&#160; Herb Sutter is great for developers looking to cross from a intermediate to efficient level in C++. </p>  <p>For developers who think they're ready to cross into the expert realm I highly recommend &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Template-Metaprogramming-Concepts-Techniques-Depth/dp/0321227255">C++ Template Metaprogramming</a>.&quot;&#160; It should convince you that being an expert it C++ is near impossible :)</p>  <p>IMHO, the first two Herb Sutter books I listed should be required reading for anyone doing C++ software development.&#160; </p></div>
