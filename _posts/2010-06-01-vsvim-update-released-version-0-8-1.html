<p>I just released an update to VsVim for Visual Studio 2010.&#160; This is available on the extension manager in Visual Studio or can be downloaded directly at the following link. </p>  <p>Link: <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329">http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329</a></p>  <p>GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim">http://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim</a></p>  <p><strong>New Features</strong></p>  <p>I forgot to add an entry when 0.8.0 was released so this is the main set changes for both 0.8.0 and 0.8.1.&#160; </p>  <ul>   <li>Motions: G, gg, H, M, L, f, t, F, T </li>    <li>Options: startofline, virtualedit, visualbell, hlsearh, ignorecase, smartcase </li>    <li>Visual Mode – put, &lt;, &gt;, ~, all motions from normal mode </li>    <li>Normal Mode – D, ~, N, Ctrl-F, Ctrl-B, </li>    <li>Command Mode – qa </li> </ul>  <ul></ul>  <p><strong>Notable Bug Fixes</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>VsVim will now look for a .vsvimrc file before .vimrc.&#160; VsVim still does not support the full set of commands and certain combinations in users .vimrc caused issues.&#160; </li>    <li>Closing a file while in Insert Mode will no longer cause an exception </li>    <li>Users can now map F1 properly in key remappings.&#160; Useful in laptops where F1 is in the place of Escape </li> </ul>  <p><strong>Future Plans</strong></p>  <p>I will likely be releasing a 0.8.2 version in very early June when I return from vacation to clean up a few items that just didn’t make it into 0.8.1. </p>  <p>The current set of planned features for 0.9.0 can be seen <a href="http://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim/issues/labels/v0.9">here.</a>&#160; Mainly this is filling out the remaining gaps users have reported.&#160; I’ve heard a few requests now for R# support in VsVim and that will be coming.&#160; I do not know yet if that will go into 0.9.0 or a later release.&#160; Will likely depend on how much feedback I get on this.&#160; </p>  <p><strong>Special Thanks</strong></p>  <p>I wanted to take a second and thank all of my users who took the time to file issues and work with me to get a solid repro so I could fix the bug.&#160; VsVim is currently a very community driven product and I would like to see it continue to be.&#160; </p>  <p>Additionally thanks to JasonMal a coworker of mine who took the F# plunge and started helping me fix issues.&#160; The help is most appreciated.&#160; </p>  <p><strong>The usual caveats and expectations</strong></p>  <p>This extension is being released by me, not by Microsoft.&#160; As such the support level for this extension is equivalent to the amount of free time I have to put into it.</p>  <p>Source for this release is available on the <a href="http://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim">GitHub project site</a>.&#160; It and the associated binaries are released under the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc707818.aspx">MS-PL</a>. </p><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>
