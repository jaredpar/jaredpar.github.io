<p>I just released an update to VsVim for Visual Studio 2010 Beta2.&#160; This should be available shortly from the extension manager in Visual Studio or it can be downloaded directly at the following link</p>  <p>Link: <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329">http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329</a></p>  <p><strong>Changes</strong></p>  <p>This is mainly a minor bug fix release.&#160; Primarily there was a bug in the command mode jump implementation that made it flaky in big buffers.&#160; Additionally I implemented the normal mode commands r and O.&#160; </p>  <p><strong>Source Code</strong></p>  <p>Source for this release is available at the following location.&#160; It is released under the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc707818.aspx">MS-PL</a>.&#160; </p>  <p><a href="http://cid-dc25b20f65f628f8.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/Public/VsVim/VsVim-0.5.4.zip">http://cid-dc25b20f65f628f8.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/Public/VsVim/VsVim-0.5.4.zip</a></p>  <p><strong>The usual caveats and expectations</strong></p>  <p>This extension is being released by me, not by Microsoft.&#160; As such the support level for this extension is equivalent to the amount of free time I have to put into it.</p></div>
