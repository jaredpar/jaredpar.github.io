<p>While investigating a crash during a suite run I found the stack walk included the destructor for a <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/50yhb8t7.aspx">CComAutoCriticalSection</a>.&nbsp; This is a fairly reliable class so I immediately suspected my code.&nbsp; I did a couple of quick checks for a double free and didn't find any.&nbsp; Then I looked a little closer at CComAutoCriticalSection and spotted that it doesn't redefine the standard copy and operator= constructor.</p> <p>This is a red flag for any class that implements RAII.&nbsp; C++ will automatically define a copy/operator= for your clasess which will amount to a memcpy.&nbsp; This means copies of two objects will be managing the same resource.&nbsp; Once the second one is destroyed it will result in a double free and hopefully a crash.&nbsp; </p> <p>I walked the hierarchy and discovered that none of the base classes redefined these methods either.&nbsp; After that it only took a few minutes to discover the bug.&nbsp; I attempt to pass the object by reference but instead ended up passing it by value.&nbsp; </p> <p>To ensure I didn't miss any other cases of this, I added the following definition to my code base and moved all instances of CComAutoCriticalSection to point to this version.&nbsp; </p><pre class="code"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255)">class</span> SafeCriticalSection : <span style="color: rgb(0,0,255)">public</span> CComAutoCriticalSection
{
<span style="color: rgb(0,0,255)">public</span>:
    SafeCriticalSection() {}
<span style="color: rgb(0,0,255)">private</span>:
    SafeCriticalSection(<span style="color: rgb(0,0,255)">const</span> SafeCriticalSection&amp;);
    SafeCriticalSection&amp; <span style="color: rgb(0,0,255)">operator</span>=(<span style="color: rgb(0,0,255)">const</span> SafeCriticalSection&amp;);
};</pre>It should be standard practice to define all 3 of the above methods on any class which has RAII semantics.&nbsp; This is not necessary if all of the members are copy safe (CComPtr&lt;&gt; for example). </div>
