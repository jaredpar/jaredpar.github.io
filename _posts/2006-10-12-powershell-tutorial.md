PowerShell is an exciting product coming out of Microsoft.  It's a shell
technology many old *nix junkies will find refreshing and very intuitive.
It's based on .Net and has a syntax feels like a mix between Pearl, C# and VB.
I've blogged about it before but due to several extraneous factors I stopped
using it for awhile.

I've recently started using it again while trying to reintruduce myself I ran
accross the following tutorial.  It appears to be written on a version of
PowerShell shortly before it was renamed from it's code name Monad.  The
syntax is slightly off in a place or two but it's a great introducion to
powershell none-the-less.
