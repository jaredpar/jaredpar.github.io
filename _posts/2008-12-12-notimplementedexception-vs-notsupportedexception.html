<p>In responding to a recent <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jaredpar/archive/2008/12/10/immutable-collections-and-backwards-compatibility.aspx">blog post</a>, one of the readers, Jeremy Gray, noted that I was using a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.notimplementedexception.aspx">NotImplementedException</a> where I should have been using a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.notsupportedexception.aspx">NotSupportedException</a>.&#160; At first I did not agree.&#160; There was a method on an interface which my underlying object could not implement therefore I felt the choice of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.notimplementedexception.aspx">NotImplementedException</a> was an appropriate.</p>  <p>However I was also not very familiar with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.notsupportedexception.aspx">NotSupportedException</a> and decided to investigate a bit more.&#160; After all, part of the fun of blogging is being wrong in a very public fashion and this was certainly a golden opportunity.&#160; The post was commenting on API design, what better way to be wrong than with a different API design issue?</p>  <p>After doing a bit of research I agree with Jeremy and draw the following distinction between the two exception types</p>  <ul>   <li>     <p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.notsupportedexception.aspx">NotSupportedException</a>: Throw this exception when a type does not implement a method for which there is a corresponding property indicating whether or not the method in question is supported. </p>      <p>For Example:</p>      <ul>       <li>IColletion&lt;T&gt;.Add -&gt; IsReadOnly </li>        <li>Stream.Seek -&gt; CanSeek </li>        <li>Stream.Write -&gt; CanWrite </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>     <p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.notimplementedexception.aspx">NotImplementedException</a>: Throw this exception when a type does not implement a method for any other reason. </p>      <p>For Example: ICollection.Count, ICloneable.Clone, etc ... [1]</p>   </li> </ul>  <p>The method in question on my previous blog post was ICollection&lt;T&gt;.Add().&#160; I was dealing with an immutable collection for which Add is not possible.&#160; Since there is a property, IsReadOnly, which serves as an indicator that Add() is not allowed, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.notsupportedexception.aspx">NotSupportedException</a> is the better choice.&#160; </p>  <p>[1] Not implementing these methods is likely a bad idea.&#160; </p></div>
