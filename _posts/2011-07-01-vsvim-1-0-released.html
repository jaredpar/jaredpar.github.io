<p>I just released an update to VsVim for Visual Studio 2010.&#160; This is available on the extension manager in Visual Studio or can be downloaded directly at the following link.&#160; [1]</p>  <p>Link: <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329">http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329</a></p>  <p>GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim">http://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim</a></p>  <p><strong>What does 1.0 mean? </strong></p>  <p>Several people asked me what 1.0 meant for VsVim?&#160; From the first release of the project to the web I’d envisioned 1.0 as the point where I had a highly functional Vim implementation in Visual Studio.&#160;&#160; Something a Vim user could add to Visual Studio and become immediately more productive.&#160; Given the feedback I’d been receiving and seeing the trend in filed issues from major features to more minor features and bugs I felt like VsVim met that goal.&#160; </p>  <p>For me personally it’s a significant milestone in what started out as a pet project to do little more than learn F# and the new Visual Studio Editor APIs.&#160; It was only after a few months of toying around in my spare time that I thought it might end up having value to people other than myself.&#160; Even then I was just as interested in publishing a working Visual Studio 2010 editor extension for documentation purposes as I was in the actual functionality (although my primary goal quickly transitioned towards functionality).&#160; I thought it would be great if I ended up with 1000 downloads in the first year.&#160; As of this writing VsVim is at 24,000 downloads and lots of positive community feedback!&#160; It all really exciting for me.</p>  <p><strong>Release Notes</strong></p>  <p>This release is mainly a bug fix release on top of previous releases: particularly in the area of motions and synchronizing settings between Visual Studio and VsVim.&#160; </p>  <p>I do want to take a second and again thank everyone who gave me feedback or filed issues throughout the entire development cycle.&#160; It really helps to have such great feedback to work against.&#160; </p>  <p><strong>The usual caveats and expectations</strong></p>  <p>This extension is being released by me, not by Microsoft.&#160; As such the support level for this extension is equivalent to the amount of free time I have to put into it.</p>  <p>Source for this release is available on the <a href="http://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim">GitHub project site</a>.&#160; It and the associated binaries are released under the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc707818.aspx">MS-PL</a>.</p>  <p>[1] The update was actually released a few weeks ago but in my excitement I forgot to blog about it.</p><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>
