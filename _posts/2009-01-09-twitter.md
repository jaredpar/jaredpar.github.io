I broke down a few weeks ago and joined [Twitter](http://twitter.com/). If
you're not familiar with Twitter, it's a lot like sitting in a room with a
bunch of people and thinking out loud. Only, it's done in IM form. It's
interesting and I find myself musing there more and more often.

Most of my tweeting is programming related. But like most other people, there
is the not so occasional rants and day to day ramblings.
