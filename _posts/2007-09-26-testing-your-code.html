<p>This is a little off topic from my typical purely technical discussion.</p> <p>I'm a huge advocate of automated code verification.&nbsp; Unit testing is preferred but really any method is acceptable as long as it gets the job done of testing your code.&nbsp; IMHO, testing is the most important part of a developers job.&nbsp; </p> <p>Besides the 3 or 4 projects I am doing as part of my job at Microsoft, I work on <strong>numerous</strong> side projects.&nbsp; Most of these come in the form of tools, libraries or little fun gadgets.&nbsp; These are written in a variety of languages; C#, VB, C++, Powershell Script, etc ...&nbsp; </p> <p>This is pretty common amongst many devs I know.&nbsp; We love our job and code before, during and after work.&nbsp; Some of the devs I know don't bother automating testing of any of their tools.&nbsp; When asked they generally respond that it's not worth it.&nbsp; </p> <p><br>I disagree strongly for certain types of tools.&nbsp; For tools and libraries I own that I expect long term usage on, I test methodically.&nbsp; On any given day I may update a couple of the tools.&nbsp; The only item that adds sanity to the situation is testing.&nbsp; This allows me to respond quickly to customer requests for features, bug fixes, etc&nbsp; and get quick verification that I haven't introduced a regression.&nbsp; </p></div>
