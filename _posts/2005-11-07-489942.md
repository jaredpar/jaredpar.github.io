One of the LUA tasks I found very frustrating was detecting whether or not I
was running as an Admin in a .BAT script.  It's very difficult to do this
correctly and the best way I found was to write a separate program that would
determine this for me.  This has a couple of limitation, the main one being
that it adds extra dependencies to your scripts and makes them harder to
deploy.

Monad has greatly simplified this task as I can do the detection code uses
simple scripts.

# Determine if I am running as an Admin  
function AmIAdmin()  
{  
 $local:ident = [System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()  
  
 foreach ( $local:groupIdent in $ident.Groups )  
 {  
  if (
$groupIdent.IsValidTargetType([System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier])
)  
  {  
   $local:groupSid =
$groupIdent.Translate([System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier])  
   if ( $groupSid.IsWellKnown("AccountAdministratorSid") -or
$groupSid.IsWellKnown("BuiltinAdministratorsSid"))  
   {  
    return $true;  
   }  
  }  
 }  
  
 return $false;  
}

I've added this to my profile so now it's really easy to determine if I can
complete an action or need to prompt for credentials in my scrips.
