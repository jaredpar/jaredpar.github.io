<p>Today Microsoft announced a new search engine called <a href="http://www.bing.com/">bing</a>.&#160; I’ve been dogfooding this engine internally for some time now and from my experience it’s a step up from the previous engine in both functionality and appearance.&#160; It’s definitely worth playing around with for awhile.</p>  <p>Announcement: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2009/may09/05-28NewSearchPR.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2009/may09/05-28NewSearchPR.mspx</a></p>  <p>While the functionality and accuracy of the results are certainly improved, this is not the biggest selling point for me.&#160; I find Live Search’s results to be very good and noticeably improving over time.&#160; I use it at home and work and rarely find a need to switch to google.com for anything.&#160; But functionality isn’t everything.</p>  <p>For me the biggest selling point is the new name.&#160; Having a search engine with a 2 word name consisting of existing words prevented it from beating google in a key aspect of my life: the vernacular.&#160; Google works great as a verb and hence allows itself to be injected into the conversation.&#160; For instance “Can you google it real quick?”&#160; </p>  <p>What to do with live search though?&#160; How can I express that I’m using live search without being too wordy?&#160; “Can you live search it” just doesn’t have the same ring to it.&#160; For awhile I shortened the name to learching (Live sEARCHING).&#160; While that works, it doesn’t quite have a good ring to it.&#160; </p>  <p>Bing on the other hand works great</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Can you bing it?</p> </blockquote>  <p>You can view the engine at <a href="http://www.bing.com">www.bing.com</a> and the team is also twittering at <a href="http://twitter.com/bing">@bing</a>.&#160; </p></div>
