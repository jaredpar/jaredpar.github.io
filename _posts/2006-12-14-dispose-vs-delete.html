<P>Programs allocate resources for use during execution.&nbsp; The problem with resources is that they are limited and often times need to be recycled.&nbsp; Languages devise constructs and patterns for developers to periodically free up resources so that their programs can continue running.&nbsp; </P>
<P>In Native C++ you typically dealt with two kinds of resources that needed recyling.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Memory</LI>
<LI>Operating System Resources (usually handles of one form or another)</LI></UL>
<P>C++ uses the "delete" operator and destructors to handle reclying both resources.&nbsp; When "delete" is called on an object it will call it's destructor and then free the memory (in that order).&nbsp; Operating system resources are typically freed in the destructor of a C++ object (<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initialization" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initialization">Resource Aquisition is Initialization</A>).&nbsp; So in one fell swoop the "delete" operator handles recycling both C++ types of resources.&nbsp; </P>
<P>.Net is garbage collected and hence only has to deal with one kind of resource. </P>
<UL>
<LI>Operating System Resources </LI></UL>
<P mce_keep="true">.Net has no "delete" call because you're not meant to be freeing memory in yourself (it's the CLR's job).&nbsp; .Net objects which handle operating system resources typically free them up via the Dispose interface.&nbsp; Most languages (including C# and VB) provide a "using" pattern by which you can easily hold onto a resource for a given time and guarantee it will be freed at the end of the operation.&nbsp; </P>
<P mce_keep="true">The problem comes when people familiar with C++ "delete" semantics attempt to apply them to the .Net dispose pattern.&nbsp; Dispose does <STRONG>not</STRONG> free managed objects memory.&nbsp; The memory of the object is still available and can be accessed just fine. </P>
<P mce_keep="true">This is not saying that's a good idea (in fact it's typically a bad one).&nbsp; Most objects provide for very unpredictable behavior once Dispose has been called and hence you shouldn't be using&nbsp;them.&nbsp; </P><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>
