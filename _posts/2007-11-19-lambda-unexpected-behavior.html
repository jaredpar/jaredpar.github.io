<p>One item you strive to avoid when you design and implement a feature is unexpected behavior.&#160; Unfortunately there is one case we couldn't avoid with Lambda's in VB9.&#160; I just ran into the this problem when coding up a handler.&#160; I wanted to disable a button when the text of particular TextBox was empty.&#160; I wrote the following code to handle the situation.</p>  <pre><span style="color: blue">AddHandler</span> c.TextChanged, <span style="color: blue">Function</span>() okButton.Enabled = (<span style="color: maroon">0</span> &lt;&gt; c.Text.Length)</pre>

<p>This doesn't quite do what I intended.&#160; This instead will simply compare the two values.&#160; </p>

<p>In VB9 Lambda Expressions are always an expression.&#160; In version 9 of VB, there is no concept of an assignment as an expression.&#160; There is only a statement version.&#160; As a result this doesn't do anything useful.&#160; </p>

<p>This has tripped up a few people along the way.&#160; It's an unfortunate side effect of only supporting expression lambdas.&#160; </p>

<p>I was able to work around this by defining a function which did what I intended.&#160; I called this function in the lambda expression and the problem was solved. </p></div>
