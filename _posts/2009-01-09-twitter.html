<p>I broke down a few weeks ago and joined <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>.&#160; If you’re not familiar with Twitter, it’s a lot like sitting in a room with a bunch of people and thinking out loud.&#160; Only, it’s done in IM form.&#160; It’s interesting and I find myself musing there more and more often.&#160; </p>  <p><a href="http://twitter.com/jaredpar">http://twitter.com/jaredpar</a></p>  <p>Most of my tweeting is programming related.&#160; But like most other people, there is the not so occasional rants and day to day ramblings.&#160; </p></div>
