<p>Visual Studio 2012 introduced <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/archive/2012/03/28/round-tripping-with-visual-studio-11.aspx">project file round tripping</a> feature.&#160; This lets developers edit the same project in Visual Studio 2010, 2012 and 2013 without the need to upgrade the project file or modify it in any way.&#160; This was a highly requested feature by customers that allowed them to edit their project no matter what version of Visual Studio they had on their machine.&#160; The previous forced upgrade model for new versions was a big adoption blocker.&#160; Now customers can just grab the latest Visual Studio version and start hacking away </p>  <p>Unfortunately this feature <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/zainnab/archive/2012/06/05/visual-studio-2012-compatibility-aka-project-round-tripping.aspx">does not work</a> on all project types including VSIX projects.&#160; This meant that Visual Studio Extension authors who wanted to developer extensions for all versions of Visual Studio were essentially locked into editing that code with 2010.&#160;&#160; This is doubly unfortunate given that extension authors are the type of developers most likely to early adopt new versions of Visual Studio.&#160; </p>  <p>The good news though is that it is possible to have a VSIX project be round tripped, it just requires a bit of special sauce to get working.&#160; Once done though a VSIX project can be fully edited, F5’d, etc … in any version of Visual Studio.&#160; </p>  <p>Originally this blog post was going to be a step by step process for getting a 2010 VSIX project into full round tripping mode.&#160; However as I started to write the post it was looking rather dull.&#160; Virtually every line was a variant of </p>  <ul>   <li>Open File &lt;…&gt; </li>    <li>Paste &lt;this odd snippet&gt; on line &lt;…&gt;</li> </ul>  <p>After pasting some rather ugly MsBuild XML into my post I realized that there was a much better way to convey this information: actually demonstrating the transition from a 2010 extension to a fully round trippable one on a real project.&#160; Essentially I decided the best way to do this was to speak in code.&#160; </p>  <p>Hence I created a GitHub project that starts with a simple 2010 extension and step by step (or commit by commit) turns it into a fully round trippable one.&#160; Every commit has detailed comments about why the edits were taken, what features they provide and what limitations remain. The full transition is available here </p>  <ul>   <li>GitHub Project: <a href="https://github.com/jaredpar/RoundTripVSIX">https://github.com/jaredpar/RoundTripVSIX</a></li>    <li>Commit Log: <a href="https://github.com/jaredpar/RoundTripVSIX/commits/master">https://github.com/jaredpar/RoundTripVSIX/commits/master</a></li> </ul>  <p>I hope that this speaks better to other extension developers out there and helps them get to a happy round trippable world.&#160; </p><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>
