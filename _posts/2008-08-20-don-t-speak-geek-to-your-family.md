In planning my recent vacation an email thread was started about who would be
picking up the groceries. Most importantly, who would be picking up the
drinks. My brother was quick to volunteer. I said in no uncertain terms I
didn't want any of drinkA [1]. In the past my brother was known to buy large
quantities of drinkA.

Or at least I thought I said it in no uncertain terms. As we arrived I opened
the fridge to find a large quantity of drinkA. I stared in disbelief and
confronted my brother. He responded with "yeah, I thought it was weird that
your email said to buy that but since you clearly wanted it ..."?? After
several other family members said the same, I placed the blame on a busy week
at work and a simple typo.

Luckily my wife brought up the email in question as proof of my mistake. The
line read

"Jason we want beer. For the purpose of the beach beer != drinkA"

To most people reading this entry the meaning is as clear as it can be. Don't
buy drinkA. Unfortunately the rest of my family are not programmers and read
this as an emphatic equals sign.

Lesson learned.

[1] The particular drink in question is not important.
