<p>In planning my recent vacation an email thread was started about who would be picking up the groceries.&#160; Most importantly, who would be picking up the drinks.&#160; My brother was quick to volunteer.&#160; I said in no uncertain terms I didn't want any of drinkA [1].&#160; In the past my brother was known to buy large quantities of drinkA.&#160; </p>  <p>Or at least I thought I said it in no uncertain terms.&#160; As we arrived I opened the fridge to find a large quantity of drinkA.&#160; I stared in disbelief and confronted my brother.&#160; He responded with &quot;yeah, I thought it was weird that your email said to buy that but since you clearly wanted it ...&quot;&#160; After several other family members said the same, I placed the blame on a busy week at work and a simple typo.&#160; </p>  <p>Luckily my wife brought up the email in question as proof of my mistake.&#160; The line read</p>  <p>&quot;Jason we want beer.&#160; For the purpose of the beach beer != drinkA&quot;</p>  <p>To most people reading this entry the meaning is as clear as it can be.&#160; Don't buy drinkA.&#160; Unfortunately the rest of my family are not programmers and read this as an emphatic equals sign.&#160; </p>  <p>Lesson learned.</p>  <p>[1] The particular drink in question is not important.</p></div>
