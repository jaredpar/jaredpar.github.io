<p>By definition, an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object">immutable object</a> in computer science is one that is not able to change.&nbsp; Parallel coding is becoming more necessary as the number of cores in a processor are increasing but not the overall speed.&nbsp; As such immutability is will become more important because it is an important asset of multithreaded programming.&nbsp; Immutable objects are inherently thread safe.&nbsp; </p> <p>Like other categorizations in computer science, there are degrees of being unable to change.&nbsp; This post is an attempt to outline and categorize several of the variations.</p> <p>Note: these are not standard categorizations.&nbsp; They are merely my attempt to name several of the scenarios you can encounter with immutable objects.</p> <p><strong>Immutable</strong></p> <p>Object itself has no fields that can change.&nbsp; In addition all of it's fields are also Immutable and thus cannot be changed.&nbsp; This object is carved in stone and short of process corruption, it will be the same in every way.</p> <p>For primitives excluding string this can be ensured by making them read only (.initonly in IL).&nbsp; For reference types the field must be read only and the type must also meet the Immutable guidelines.</p> <p>Types with meet the Immutable guarantee are inherently thread safe.&nbsp; They are not subject to race conditions because they cannot be changed and thus viewed differently between threads.&nbsp; </p> <p><strong>Shallow Immutable</strong></p> <p>The direct contents of this object must be immutable in the sense that they cannot be changed to point to another object.&nbsp; However there is no guarantee that all of the fields are themselves immutable.&nbsp; </p> <p>All of the fields in the object must be read only.&nbsp; For primitive values this is enough to guarantee them meeting the Immutable guidelines and hence Shallow Immutable.&nbsp; For reference types this will ensure they will point to the same object thus doing all that is needed to meet the Shallow Immutable Guarantee.&nbsp; </p> <p>Types with this guarantee are thread safe to a degree.&nbsp; They are thread safe as long as you are accessing the fields with meet the Immutable guarantee.&nbsp; You can also access the references which are read only as long as you do not call any instance methods.&nbsp; For instance a Null check is thread safe.&nbsp; </p> <p><strong>Shallow Safe Immutable</strong></p> <p>Slightly stronger guarantee than Shallow Immutable.&nbsp; For all fields that are read only but not immutable, the type must be thread safe.&nbsp; </p> <p>Types which meet this guarantee are thread safe also to a degree.&nbsp; They are as thread safe as the fields which are guaranteed to be thread safe.&nbsp; </p></div>
