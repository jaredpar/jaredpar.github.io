<p>People love to chat about how to conduct a C++ interview on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=c%2B%2B+interview">newsgroups</a>.&#160; Eventually these topics will shift into a discussion about what questions a candidate <strong>must</strong> know in order for them to get a hire from a particular interview.&#160; Unfortunately these questions tend to be items like the following.</p>  <ol>   <li>What happens when you delete NULL?</li>    <li>Explain how exceptions affect constructor initialization.</li>    <li>Which constructors are called for the following: SomeType a = SomeType(b); </li> </ol>  <p>Sure these questions are valid parts of the language and knowing them is a plus and demonstrates a deal of mastery over the language.&#160; But not knowing them should by no means by a deal breaker.&#160; The goal of an interview is to spot good developers who will become a contributing member of the team.&#160; Good developers are motivated and passionate problem solvers.&#160; These questions are testing little more than memorization.&#160; It’s easy to memorize rules after the fact.&#160; It’s much more difficult to teach problem solving skills.&#160; </p>  <p>The problem with questions like the above is that a developer could be both passionate and competent in C++ and never have come across these rules.&#160; C++ is an unbelievably huge language and can operate in many different ways where these type of situations simply don’t come up.&#160; For instance, I’ve known several very good C++ developers that spent the majority of their time working with COM.&#160; COM prefers HRESULTs to Exceptions and hence they never used exceptions in C++.&#160; Once we introduced exceptions into the code base, it took about 30 minutes to explain the rules and we were done.&#160; </p>  <p>C++ interviews should focus on the qualities that make a good developer: problem solving and passion.&#160; Of course a language based interview should certainly focus on the foundations of C/C+.&#160; Items like pointers, stack vs. heap and the basics of memory management.&#160; But don’t hinge the deal on little items that can be quickly taught.&#160; Otherwise you’ll end up turning away good developers.&#160; </p></div>
