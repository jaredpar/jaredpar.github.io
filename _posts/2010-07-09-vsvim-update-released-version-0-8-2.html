<p>I just released an update to VsVim for Visual Studio 2010.&#160; This is available on the extension manager in Visual Studio or can be downloaded directly at the following link.</p>  <p>Link: <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329">http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329</a></p>  <p>GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim">http://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim</a></p>  <p>This is a bug fix release and contains no large features.&#160; </p>  <p><strong>Notable Bug Fixes</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Both normal mode append commands, ‘a’ and ‘A’, now correctly position the cursor after the last character of the line in all cases.&#160; </li>    <li>Several issues around the display of the : in command mode </li>    <li>Motions e/E now correctly move past the end of the word when used as a movement</li>    <li>The dw edit lead to exceptions when deleting some times of leading whitespace </li>    <li>Tooltips no longer interfere with normal mode commands</li>    <li>Several subtle motion issues</li> </ul>  <p><strong>Future Plans</strong></p>  <p>We are primarily working on 0.9.0 features at this point which can be seen <a href="http://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim/issues/labels/v0.9">here</a>.&#160; This release is continuing to fill in the gaps users have reported.&#160; Depending on how long 0.9.0 takes there may be a 0.8.3 release but right now it looks like 0.9.0 will be the next version.</p>  <p><strong>The usual caveats and expectations</strong></p>  <p>This extension is being released by me, not by Microsoft.&#160; As such the support level for this extension is equivalent to the amount of free time I have to put into it.</p>  <p>Source for this release is available on the <a href="http://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim">GitHub project site</a>.&#160; It and the associated binaries are released under the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc707818.aspx">MS-PL</a>.</p><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>
