I was reading a post on Coding Horror the other day about programming books
and how developers [don't read enough of
them.](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001108.html)?? I readily agree
with the first two points in the article that 1) most programming books suck
and 2) books are sold by weight not by volume.?? Reading is an integral part of
a developers life.?? Blogs are a great source of info but books are a necessity
as well.

In my experience, the hardest language to find a good book for is C++.?? Far
too many books and far too few which are worth reading.?? Here are my favorite
which 1) don't suck and 2) don't weigh a ton but have a enormous amount of
information.

  1. Herb Sutter: 
    1. [Exceptional C++](http://www.amazon.com/Exceptional-Engineering-Programming-Solutions-Depth/dp/0201615622)
    2. [More Exceptional C++](http://www.amazon.com/More-Exceptional-Engineering-Programming-Depth/dp/020170434X/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b/105-5993487-4416400)
    3. [Exceptional C++ Style](http://www.amazon.com/Exceptional-C%2B%2B-Style-Engineering-Depth/dp/0201760428/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1209624394&sr=1-3)
  2. Scott Meyers
    1. [Effective C++](http://www.amazon.com/Template-Metaprogramming-Concepts-Techniques-Depth/dp/0321227255)
    2. [More Effective C++](http://www.amazon.com/More-Effective-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/020163371X/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b)

Others may disagree but I classify the Scott Meyer books as being good for
developers looking to break into the intermediate level.?? Herb Sutter is great
for developers looking to cross from a intermediate to efficient level in C++.

For developers who think they're ready to cross into the expert realm I highly
recommend "[C++ Template Metaprogramming](http://www.amazon.com/Template-
Metaprogramming-Concepts-Techniques-Depth/dp/0321227255)."?? It should convince
you that being an expert it C++ is near impossible :)

IMHO, the first two Herb Sutter books I listed should be required reading for
anyone doing C++ software development.
