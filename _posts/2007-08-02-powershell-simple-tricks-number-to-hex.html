<p>When investigating bugs a lot of times you start out with an unfamiliar HRESULT value.&nbsp; Searching the web will give you a hint of what the problem is and the real search can begin.&nbsp; If you get this error out of a log file it can come in a base 10 value versus a base 16 (hex).&nbsp; Searching for your base 10 code is much less efficient that the hex counter part.&nbsp; No matter.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>C:\Users\jaredpar&gt; "0x{0:x}" -f -2147023293 | out-clipboard</p></div>
