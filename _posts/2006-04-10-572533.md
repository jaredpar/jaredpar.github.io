I've started experimenting with Code Access Security at home.  This derives
from my desire to better understand .NET security and my recent fascination
with ClickOnce applications.

This weekend I learned a hard lesson in security.  I have a couple of
ClickOnce apps.  ClickOnce Visual Studio integration has a great feature that
will root around in your code and attempt to determine the minimal permission
set needed to run your application.

I started playing with this on one of my relatively simple applications.  It
contains several forms and opens up a couple of WebRequest objects but nothing
terribly special.  However the analysis said that my app needed to run with
Full Trust (highest level).  Unfortunately the app did not provide any more
information besides that.

It took an hour of rooting around but in the end I discovered the culprit was
the PropertyGrid instance on my form.  It turns out that the PropertyGrid
requires "Full Trust" to be used even though it's not noted in the
documentation.
