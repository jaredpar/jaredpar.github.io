<P>The new version of the Visual Studio 2008 Beta2 SDK was just released.&nbsp; Among the many new samples is a basic expression evaluator sample.&nbsp; This sample shows you how to add basic debugger support to a managed language in Visual Studio.&nbsp; </P>
<P>This is the first version of the sample and mainly has support for locals and member expansion.&nbsp; I'm planning on adding more features in future releases.&nbsp; Since this is mainly to provide users with guidelines on how to build an EE,&nbsp;any requests we get will be given a lot of consideration. </P>
