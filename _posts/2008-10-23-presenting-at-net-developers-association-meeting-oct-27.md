I will be presenting at the [Net Developers Associating](http://www.netda.net/Static.aspx) meeting this upcoming Monday.  If you're interested in hearing me ramble on in person please drop by.

Event Details:

  * When: Oct 27 7:00PM 
  * Where: Microsoft Building 40: The Steptoe Room ([Map](http://maps.live.com/OneClickDirections.aspx?mkt=en-us&rtp=~pos.47.63652099774846_-122.1333360671997&FORM=LLMP)) 
  * Who: Me 
  * Why: Blogging's fun but it's great to go out and talk to people in person 

My talk will center around how to get the most out of a LINQ query. I'll be covering a lot of the misunderstood aspects of LINQ such as deferred execution. Most bit of the talk will focus on the [MSDN article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc721610.aspx) I wrote a few months back.
