The August issue of MSDN magazine will be carrying an article I wrote this
spring.?? In it I toy around with using the deferred execution and lazy
evaluation properties of LINQ to create more responsive UI code.

You can view the article [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-

As usual I appreciate any feedback you have.
