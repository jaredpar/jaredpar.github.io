<p>Occasionally the debate will come as to when it's OK to use type inference in order to declare a variable.&#160; There appear to be three groups in this debate.</p>  <ol>   <li>Whenever it's possible</li>    <li>Only when it's absolutely clear what the type is </li>    <li>Never, type inference is evil</li> </ol>  <p>I fall into camp #1 and here are my reasons</p>  <ul>   <li>It does not reduce type safety.&#160; This doesn't allow for any late binding, type unsafe functions or the like.&#160; It simply lets the compiler chose the type for you.</li>    <li>It will actually increase type safety in your code.&#160; The best example of this is the foreach statement on non-generic IEnumerable instances.&#160; These foreach statements are all technically unsafe because the compiler must do a cast of the Current member under the hood.&#160; This declaration looks no different than the type safe generic version of IEnumerable.&#160; Using var will force you to write an explicit cast.&#160;&#160; </li> </ul>  <blockquote>   <p>foreach (SomeType cur in col)</p> </blockquote>  <blockquote>   <p>foreach ( var cur in col.Cast&lt;SomeType&gt;())</p> </blockquote>  <ul>   <li>Maintains the principles of DRY.&#160; This is mostly true for cases where you have an explicit constructor on the RHS.</li>    <li>For some types, this is a requirement in order to use the type (anonymous types for instance).&#160; I'm a big fan of consistency and since I must have some instances use type inference, I'd like to use them everywhere.&#160; </li>    <li>Makes refactoring easier.&#160; I re-factor, a lot.&#160; I constantly split up or rename types.&#160; Often in such a way that refactoring tools don't fixup all of the problems.&#160; With var declarations I don't have to worry because they just properly infer their new type and happily chug along.&#160; For explicit type cases I have to manually update all of the type names.&#160; </li>    <li>Less typing with no loss of functionality.</li> </ul>  <p>The best argument I've heard against type inference is that it reduces readability since you can't look at a variable and know it's type.&#160; True, but just hover over the declaration and the IDE will display the type.&#160; Yes this is not possible with a non-IDE editor but how often do you use one? </p></div>
