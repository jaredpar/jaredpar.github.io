Recently the MSDN blog architecture got a long overdue update to a new
infrastructure.?? Most of these changes are very welcome but a few are causing
a bit of issues for me and readers

  * My blog URL changed to - <http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jaredpar/>
  * Additionally my RSS feed changed to - <http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jaredpar/rss.aspx>
  * Several of my recent posts were deleted during the upgrade.?? I will be reposting them today but they will unfortunately re-appear in your RSS reader

All of the old URL???s should continue to work for the foreseeable future.?? But
I imagine at some point the redirects will be removed so please take a minute
and update your readers.
