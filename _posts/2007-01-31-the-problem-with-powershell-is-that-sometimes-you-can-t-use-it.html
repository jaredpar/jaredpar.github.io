<P>PowerShell puts the fun back in scripting and it's horrfying but every now and again I'm forced to write a good old batch script.&nbsp; Batch is good enough to get most jobs done it's just not as "fun" as PowerShell.&nbsp; Recently it came up in an internal alias about how to detect if you're running on Vista from a batch script.&nbsp; </P>
<P>for /f "tokens=4 delims=.] " %%i in ('ver') do set OSVERSION=%%i<BR></P>
<P>This parses the output of the "ver" command in batch and gives back the result.&nbsp; If %OSVERSION% is 6 then you're on Vista.</P><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>
