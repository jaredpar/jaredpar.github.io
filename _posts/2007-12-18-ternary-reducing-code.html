<p>I like my scripts to be readable and terse.&nbsp; They're scripts after all and I want to get the most done with the least amount of code.&nbsp; There's a lot to be said for having a readable script but I only value that when I intend to keep the script around for awhile.&nbsp; </p> <p>PowerShell does not have a ternary operator and that often frustrates me as I end up writing lots of verbose code.&nbsp; </p> <p>Once again, fix it by introducing a small function into my profile.&nbsp; Not quite a true ternary operator because it evaluates both of the result arguments.&nbsp; But it does the trick for most situations. </p> <p>function Get-Ternary()<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; param ( [bool]$condition = $(throw "Need a conditional"),<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $valueTrue = $(throw "Need a value for the true condition"),<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $valueFalse = $(throw "Need a value for the false condition") )<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if ( $condition )<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return $valueTrue<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return $valueFalse<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>} <p>Now I can type  <p>PS&gt; Get-Ternary $cond 1 42</p></div>
