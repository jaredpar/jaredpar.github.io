I spent a bit of my college days in *nix land.  Much of that time was spent writing and maintaining scripts for my various shell accounts.  After I switched to primarily developing on Windows, I was frustrated by the Windows CMD shell and eventually lost interest in scripting.

Lately I've been playing with Monad at work and it's revived my interest.  It takes a few minutes to get used to the new noun-verb command structure but once you do it's extremely powerful and fun to use.  I am looking forward to writing some commandlets once I have a few spare cycles.  Until then just interesting scripts.

    ps | sort-object ProcessName | where { ($_.HandleCount -gt 0) } | select-object ProcessName,HandleCount | Format-table -autosize
