<P>An item I try to avoid in any API I create are methods which ... </P>
<OL>
<LI>Take more than one parameter</LI>
<LI>One of the parameters is a boolean</LI></OL>
<P>Typically this pattern indicates a True/False option on an operation type.&nbsp; This boolean value turns on or off some type of scenario for that operation.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The reason I dislike this is that it's not maintainable.&nbsp; I constantly forget what the boolean value means and it makes my code less readable to people who are reviewing.&nbsp; The reviewer sees SomeOperation(1, true) and they constantly ask "What does true mean?".&nbsp; And even though most programmers won't admit this, years after you write the code and you're tracking down a bug, you also forget what true meant in this case.</P>
<P>Instead I prefer to break down the operation into three different methods.&nbsp; Say the operation in question loaded a particular piece of data from a file.&nbsp; The data block can have references to other data blocks.&nbsp; In some cases I only want the first layer of data and in others I would like to load all referencable data blocks.&nbsp; Here is the break down of operations I will create.</P>
<OL>
<LI>public LoadDataBlock(identifier)</LI>
<LI>public LoadDataBlockRecursive(identifier)</LI>
<LI>private LoadDataBlockImpl(identifier, recursive)</LI></OL>
<P>The private implementation takes the boolean indicating the option.&nbsp; This gives the implementor of the method the flexibility of having the boolean option parameter.&nbsp; The big win here is for the caller.&nbsp; They don't need to know about this hidden parameter and instead will have two clear API method calls.&nbsp; </P>
