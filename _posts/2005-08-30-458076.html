<P>It's very important to read the documentation of this method before actually using it.&nbsp; A common misunderstanding of this method is that it will throw if the path does not exist.&nbsp; If Path.GetFullPath() discovers that the directory does exists it will make sure the user has access to the path.&nbsp; In the abscence of a directory it will skip the check and just return the canonicalized path.&nbsp; </P>
<P>This produces some interesting behavior with relative paths.&nbsp; Say that your program exists in c:\foo\MyApp.exe and you run it from that directory.&nbsp; If you called Path.GetFullPath() and passed in "..\..\..\..\..\bar.cs", what would you expect it to do?&nbsp; My initial guess was that it would throw since that path goes above the root directory however it will just <EM>pretend</EM> it didn't and return c:\bar.cs.&nbsp; </P><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>
