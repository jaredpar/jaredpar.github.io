<p>I just released an update to VsVim for Visual Studio 2010 Beta2.&nbsp; This should be available shortly from the extension manager in Visual Studio or it can be downloaded directly at the following link</p>  <p>Link: <a mce_href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329" href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329">http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329</a></p>  <p><b>New Features</b></p>  <ul>   <li>Visual Mode Support      <ul>       <li>Character, Line and Block Mode </li>        <li>All movement commands supported </li>        <li>Basic insert-delete operations added </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>Command Mode Commands - :substitute, :redo, </li>    <li>Support for mark navigation to global marks </li>    <li>Implemented almost all delete-insert operations in relevant modes </li>    <li>Normal Mode Commands: CTRL-R, </li>    <li>Expanded range parsing </li> </ul>  <p><b>Notable Bug Fixes</b></p>  <ul>   <li>Issues with disabling conflicting key bindings on startup </li>    <li>Issues with not properly intercepting standard VS commands and routing them to Vim </li>    <li>Timing issue on startup that would cause certain components to not get created </li> </ul>  <p><b>Source Code</b></p>  <p>Source for this release is available at the following location.&nbsp; It is released under the <a mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc707818.aspx" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc707818.aspx">MS-PL</a>.</p>  <p><a title="http://cid-dc25b20f65f628f8.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/Public/VsVim/VsVim-0.7.0.zip" mce_href="http://cid-dc25b20f65f628f8.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/Public/VsVim/VsVim-0.7.0.zip" href="http://cid-dc25b20f65f628f8.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/Public/VsVim/VsVim-0.7.0.zip">http://cid-dc25b20f65f628f8.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/Public/VsVim/VsVim-0.7.0.zip</a></p>  <p><b>Future Plans</b></p>  <p>The next planned major update is version 0.8.0.&nbsp; It will consist of the following updates</p>  <ul>   <li>Expanded set of commands supported in all modes </li>    <li>The . operator in normal mode </li>    <li>Ability for users to change settings.&nbsp; Settings supported is baked into VsVim I just haven’t exposed it via command mode or any UI </li>    <li>Better UI in general.&nbsp; Right now I use MessageBox.Show for any UI I need to display other than status bar updates.&nbsp; I would like to expand that to include a more configurable UI </li> </ul>  <p>I also expect to release a 0.7.1 version once the Visual Studio RC goes public.&nbsp; As part of releasing RC, all Beta2 extensions will be unpublished in the gallery and I’ll need to release an RC compatible version.&nbsp; At that time I will provide a link to the Beta2 binaries for those not upgrading to the RC.&nbsp; </p>  <p><b>The usual caveats and expectations</b></p>  <p>This extension is being released by me, not by Microsoft.&nbsp; As such the support level for this extension is equivalent to the amount of free time I have to put into it.</p></div>
