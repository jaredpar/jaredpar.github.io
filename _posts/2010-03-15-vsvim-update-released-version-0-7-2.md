**New Features**

  * Key mapping: map, remap, noremap and there many variations are now supported
  * Reading vimrc?? files on startup
  * A FAQ: <http://wiki.github.com/jaredpar/VsVim/faq>

**Future Plans**

Originally I planned on moving straight from 0.7.0 to 0.8.0.?? However shortly
after Visual Studio 2010 RC was released I saw a significant update in number
of users for VsVim.?? With the new users came many new issues and feature
requests.?? Several of the requests made, such as key remapping, were blocking
issues for users.?? As such I decided to prioritize them over getting flashy
new features into the project.

Going forward I intend to leave the 0.7.X branch as the way of unblocking
users and to have 0.8.0 be the release for new value add features which aren???t
necessarily blocking users (such as the . operator and a proper margin instead
of using the status bar).?? I hope with this release I can unblock the majority
of users and focus on getting 0.8.0 out the door.?? But I will release a 0.7.3
if there is further need for unblocking users.

Thanks to everyone who took the time to notify me about issues either by
filing bugs on GitHub or sending me an email!

**Other Notes**

VsVim is now fully available on GitHub!

  * <http://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim>

In addition to source code control I am using GitHub for both [Bug
Tracking](http://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim/issues) and a
[FAQ](http://wiki.github.com/jaredpar/VsVim/faq).?? Bug tracking is open to the
public so please file any issues or feature requests there.

**The usual caveats and expectations**

This extension is being released by me, not by Microsoft.?? As such the support
level for this extension is equivalent to the amount of free time I have to
put into it.

Source for this release is available on the GitHub project site.?? It and the
associated binaries are released under the [MS-PL](http://msdn.microsoft.com
/en-us/library/cc707818.aspx).
