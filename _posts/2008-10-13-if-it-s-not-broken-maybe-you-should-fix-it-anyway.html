<p>I know this is goes against conventional wisdom but it's something I believe in.&#160; Every sufficiently large project has that section of code nobody wants to go near.&#160; The mere mention of it causes people to leave the room.&#160; It usually has a couple of properties</p>  <ol>   <li>Old and Stagnant </li>    <li>Critical or important routine </li>    <li>Fragile </li>    <li>Written by a developer who doesn't work there anymore </li>    <li>Undocumented </li>    <li>Untested </li>    <li>Poorly understood </li> </ol>  <p>But it works and usually has for several releases.&#160; By conventional wisdom it is considered &quot;unbroken&quot; and not worthy of changing.&#160; </p>  <p>I disagree.&#160; Very often I find towards the end of the cycle more and more bugs start popping up in this code.&#160; It's a pattern I've seen in many groups across releases.&#160; These bugs are extremely expensive to fix because they are a) at the end of the cycle and b) being make in a piece of code that no one understands.&#160; Since it's not broken nobody bothered with the code and hence it stayed poorly understood (and likely just as untested).&#160; The bugs are doubly worse because no one wants to go near that code for fear of breaking the world.&#160; </p>  <p>Why let this code hang around in it's current state?&#160; It's bad and no one understands why.&#160; It's a constant source of pain late in the cycle and often in the middle.&#160; </p>  <p>I prefer to take a more proactive approach; fix it.&#160; </p>  <p>At the end of a product cycle I like to identify these pieces of code and attack them in-between releases.&#160; This is a relatively safe point in the release cycle to change poorly understood code.&#160; There is an entire release cycle ahead to catch the bugs introduced (and there will be some).&#160; </p>  <p>I don't break this code without thought.&#160; I prefer to take a pragmatic approach to the code in the following steps. </p>  <ul>   <li>Attempt to understand the intent of the code (easier said than done).&#160; I contact the original author if possible </li>    <li>Poll the more senior developers on their understanding of what the code does </li>    <li>Design a new architecture if needed </li>    <li>Design a test plan (this is the absolute most important step.&#160; Why fix this if you don't bother testing it?) </li>    <li>Make the change </li> </ul>  <p>I've done this, or overseen someone else, on several pieces of code over the last few years.&#160; Thus far it's been a very big success.&#160; </p></div>
