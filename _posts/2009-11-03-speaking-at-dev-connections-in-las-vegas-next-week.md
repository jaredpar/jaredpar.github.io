Next week I will be speaking at [Dev
Connections](http://www.devconnections.com/shows/FALL2009VS/default.asp?s=136)
in Las Vegas. I will be running the following sessions

  * VMS02: Future Directions for Visual Basic
  * VMS04: Microsoft Visual Basic IDE Tips and Tricks

Both of these talks will spend a bit of time talking about all of the progress
and exciting new features we've added in Dev10. Given I primarily work on the
IDE these days, expect a bit of IDE content to work it's way into the Future
Directions talk as well.
