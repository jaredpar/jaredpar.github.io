<P>While working on a recent bug a question came up about how permissions work on NTFS.&nbsp; Take the following example directory path 
<P>
<P>c:\University\Fall2005\Homework.cpp</P>
<P>Now imagine that our user University\john had the access rights that were specified below.&nbsp; For completeness assume full control for Local System and Administrators.&nbsp; </P>
<UL>
<LI>University: Read &amp; Execute, List Folder Contents, Read (All <STRONG>Allow</STRONG>) 
<LI>Fall2005: Read &amp; Execute, List Folder Contents, Read (All <STRONG>Deny</STRONG>) 
<LI>Homework.cpp: Full Control</LI></UL>
<P>The question we had was whether or not University\John would be able to successfull access (read, edit, save) Homework.cpp.&nbsp; Some of us with Unix backgrounds guessed that he would not while most of the rest said that he would.&nbsp; </P>
<P>After a couple of minutes of discussion we cooked up an example and it turns out that University\John does indeed have Full Control of the Homework.cpp file.&nbsp; To be honest, this caught me completely by surprise.&nbsp; I did quite a bit of *nix programming in college and was incorrectly relying on my knowledge of the *nix file system particulars to answer this question.&nbsp; </P>
<P>If this were a similar *nix example (say /University/Fall2005/Homework.cpp) our user john would not have access to the file.&nbsp; When a file lookup is done in Linux, the VFS layer&nbsp;starts at the base path and looks up every file system object from the start of the path to the actual file.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the current process does not have sufficient permissions to access any object on the path, the search fails (as it would for the Fall2005 object).&nbsp; </P>
<P>I don't know a lot about NTFS but I can only assume that it performs a lookup in a different manner.&nbsp; Then again, assumption got me into this problem ...</P>
