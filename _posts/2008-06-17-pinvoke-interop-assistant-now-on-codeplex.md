I'm happy to announce that the [PInvoke Interop Assistant](http://blogs.msdn.com/jaredpar/archive/2008/03/14/making-pinvoke-easy.aspx.) tool is now available on CodePlex. This includes the binaries, source code and the dev authored unit tests.

It is hosted on the more general CLR Interop Tools page.

<http://www.codeplex.com/clrinterop>

I will be actively maintaining this tool in the future and (hopefully) adding more features. There were several features we cut just before release due to QA costing that I would like to add back (including VS integration, wrapper functions).

Please post any suggestions you have for the tool on the site and we will definitely consider them.
