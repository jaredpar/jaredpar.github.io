<p>After 4+ years on the languages team it’s time for me to move onto the next adventure.&#160; I joined the languages team in the winter of 2006.&#160; Since then I’ve worked on pretty much every part of the language experience including the compiler, debugger and IDE, shipped 2 releases of Visual Studio, several independent projects and fixed the occasional bug.&#160; </p>  <p>I will be joining an operating systems incubation project inside of Microsoft.&#160; It’s an exciting project which is exploring the world of multi-core programming and other aspects of the stack that I am deeply interested in.&#160; </p>  <p>The downside of working on a team for 4+ years though is you tend to get rather attached to the people and product.&#160; Visual Studio and in particular the languages team is full of a lot of great people who’ve had a lasting professional and personal impact on me.&#160;&#160; It was a great experience and I will miss it all.&#160; </p>  <p>This of course won’t stop me from continuing to blog on Visual Studio, languages, the BCL, .Net or really anything else that comes to mind.&#160; Nor will it prevent my continued work on Visual Studio extensions such as VsVim.&#160; I’ll just be doing all of it from a different building.&#160; </p><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>
