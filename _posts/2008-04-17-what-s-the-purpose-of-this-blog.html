<p>I've had a couple people ask me this question about my blog.&#160; The simple answer is: to explore my adventures in code, coding, patterns and pretty much anything else related to programming.&#160; </p>  <p>I realize from a readers perspective my topics may appear somewhat random.&#160; After all I post in C#,VB,C++ and Powershell with varying degrees of frequency.&#160; I jump from patterns to specialized templates to threading to random gotchas to API Design.&#160; The reason for the jumping is I post topics close to the projects I'm working on and I work on a lot of projects :).&#160; At any given time I'm working on one of the following items.</p>  <ul>   <li>My job as developer on the VB Debugger and IDE</li>    <li>My personal managed utility libraries (non-UI and UI) [1]</li>    <li>The <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jaredpar/archive/2008/03/14/making-pinvoke-easy.aspx">PInvoke Interop Assistant</a></li>    <li>Several internal tools </li>    <li>My scripting environment</li>    <li>Customer reported issues in forums</li>    <li>This blog </li>    <li>Whatever happens to capture my interest at the time.</li> </ul>  <p>Whenever I discover anything interesting, find a bug or see yet another pattern/design I like or dislike I try to blog about it.&#160; I do this for two reasons. </p>  <ol>   <li>My own personal sanity.&#160; I've found through years of programming that it's very unlikely you will hit an error only once.&#160; Instead you're likely to see it time and time again.&#160; Blogging about it both helps firm the issue into memory and gives me a great reference to fall back onto the next time I see that bug.&#160; It's really simple to lookup a blog post by tag and read it or point a coworker to it.</li>    <li>Everyone else's sanity.&#160; The more people who write about issues, the more likely someone else will find an answer when they enter a problem into a search engine.&#160; </li> </ol>  <p>In short, I love to write and talk about code and this is a great forum.</p>  <p>[1] Hopefully on it's way to <a href="http://code.msdn.com">http://code.msdn.com</a> so I don't have to keep posting little snippets and making users paste snippets from various blog entries to get a simple working example.&#160; </p></div>
