<p>I just released an update to VsVim for Visual Studio 2010.&#160; This is available on the extension manager in Visual Studio or can be downloaded directly at the following link.</p>  <p>Link: <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329">http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329</a></p>  <p>GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim">http://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim</a></p>  <p>This update includes the following </p>  <ul>   <li>Full support for :substitute including the confirm option </li>    <li>Many bug fixes for the “.” (repeat) command </li>    <li>Vim style regular expression support.&#160; Previous releases used BCL regexes </li>    <li>Support for the + (clipboard) register </li>    <li>And of course many bug fixes </li> </ul>  <p><strong>Future Plans</strong></p>  <p>The original plan for VsVim was to focus on getting a highly functional Vim emulator as the 1.0 release and then moving onto items like Resharper integration for 1.1.&#160; At our current pace this would put VsVim 1.0 out the door in just a few more weeks.&#160; But after receiving a lot of feedback from users it’s become clear that integration with Resharper is more important than rounding out the last few major Vim items.&#160; Hence we’ve decided to shift the focus of the next few releases to the following</p>  <ul>   <li>0.9.4 – Resharper support. </li>    <li>0.9.5 – Finish remaining core Vim features (macros mainly at this point) </li>    <li>1.0 – Mostly bug fixes on top of 0.9.5 </li> </ul>  <p>We were really looking forward to putting the 1.0 stamp on VsVim but are equally as excited by the proposition of getting Resharper (and likely similar products like CodeRush) working.&#160; We hope to have a Beta release of the support by early next week for users to bash on.&#160; When the builds are available I’ll announce them on <a href="http://twitter.com/jaredpar">twitter</a> and upload them to the github site.&#160; </p>  <p><strong>The usual caveats and expectations</strong></p>  <p>This extension is being released by me, not by Microsoft.&#160; As such the support level for this extension is equivalent to the amount of free time I have to put into it.</p>  <p>Source for this release is available on the <a href="http://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim">GitHub project site</a>.&#160; It and the associated binaries are released under the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc707818.aspx">MS-PL</a>.</p><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>
