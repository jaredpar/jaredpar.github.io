Unfortunately when creating Live Search, the live team did not use a term
which could easily be converted to a verb (i.e. google and google-ing). The
term "live searching" doesn't really flow well in a hallway conversation
nearly as well as google-ing.

  * I live searched that movie John was talking about ... 

I considered for awhile just using the "googling" term for both using live
search and google. But this wouldn't allow me to quickly correlate the goods
and bads of each search engine. I needed a new term.

Thus learching was born:?? It's short for "Live sEARCHing". When pronouncing
it should rhyme with "searching."

Anyone else with a better term?
