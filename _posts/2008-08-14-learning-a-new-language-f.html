<p>Time again to learn a new language.&#160; I enjoy picking up a new language every now and again.&#160; It's a great way to branch out your skill set and usually leads to new programming techniques in languages that are a part of professional or hobby life.</p>  <p>But why bother?&#160; The popular languages have a lot of common elements : functions, types, etc ...&#160; With all of the common elements what can learning a new language really give you?&#160; </p>  <p>It's true that there are a lot of common elements (especially for .Net based languages).&#160; But what really interests me are the features which make the individual language extremely productive.&#160; Most languages have a feature or two that really makes it worth learning.&#160; They greatly increase the productivity of the developer.&#160; Often full libraries are designed around these features.&#160; For instance </p>  <ul>   <li>C++ and&#160; Templates      <ul>       <li>This is somewhat special in that it's extraordinarily powerful for both good and evil </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>VB and late binding </li>    <li>C# and iterators </li> </ul>  <p>What's great about learning these features is I can often import them into my current heavily used languages.&#160; For instance, even though C#/VB don't directly support functional style programming, I've spent a bit of time over the last few months building libraries that make it fairly easy to incorporate them into either language.&#160; This added a deal of flexibility into my programs and a real functional feel.&#160; </p>  <p>Lately I've been focusing on immutable/persistant data structures, lambda expressions and tuples.&#160; This makes F# a natural choice for a language to learn.&#160; While I tend to program in a somewhat functional style this will be the first functional language I've heavily invested my time in.&#160; For awhile I did a bit of Haskell but nothing serious.&#160; </p>  <p>I intend to blog about the joys and not so joyful moments of this process.</p></div>
