<p>In an effort to post more often and with greater effect, I've been trying to divide my posts into short, targeted posts and longer in depth posts.&nbsp; Thus far my short posts aren't nearly as short as I'd like them to be and end up being much closer to my in depth postings in length.</p> <p>In order to better hit this goal today will be a short post.</p> <p>Happy April Fools Day!</p></div>
