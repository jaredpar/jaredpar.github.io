Don't forget to join us this Wednesday at 10am PST to discuss the new Team System Testing infrastructure.  Topics include the Profiler, Test Tools (Unit, Generic, Manual), Web Load Testing, and Code Analysis (FxCop & PREFast).  We have questions for you, will answer questions from you, and will chat about the exciting new technology.  We'll be in the "MSDN Chat Room".
