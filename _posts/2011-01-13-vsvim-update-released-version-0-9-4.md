I just released an update to VsVim for Visual Studio 2010. This is available
on the extension manager in Visual Studio or can be downloaded directly at the
following link.

GitHub: <http://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim>

This update includes the following

  * R# 5.1 Support 
  * Snippet Support
  * Many fixes to key mapping
  * And of course many bug fixes

I do want to take a second and thank [Martin
Lemburg](https://github.com/MartinLemburg) and
[rride](https://github.com/rride) for the many detailed issues they filed
during the 0.9.3 release. It really helps to have such great feedback to work
against.

**Future Plans**

I'm aiming for 0.9.5 to be a 3 week release cycle. It will expand the third
party editor support to include DevExpress / CodeRush support and clean up
many of the existing bugs. After that we'll be pushing hard to get 1.0 out
the door.

**The usual caveats and expectations**

This extension is being released by me, not by Microsoft. As such the support
level for this extension is equivalent to the amount of free time I have to
put into it.

Source for this release is available on the [GitHub project
site](http://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim). It and the associated binaries are
released under the [MS-PL](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-
us/library/cc707818.aspx).
