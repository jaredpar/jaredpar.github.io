<P>It's somewhat frustrating to try and post code to the internet for your blog.&nbsp; Getting the color scheme right isn't easy if you're like me and don't use a standard color scheme for coding.&nbsp; I prefer a very dark coding environment (inkpot) and most people don't want to read code in that scheme.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Someone just led me onto a great website that will auto-colorize your code.&nbsp; </P>
