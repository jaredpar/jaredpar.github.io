<p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Segoe UI;">Lately I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot about peoples interview processes and it inspired me to share my process for interviewing college candidates.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been doing interviews at Microsoft for ~10 years now and developed this process over that time.&nbsp; </span>The format for the interviews are typically 1 hour with just me and the candidate.&nbsp; Usually in my office or occasionally a conference room.&nbsp; Unfortunately 1 hour is a very short amount of time in which to judge a candidate and I try to combat that by planning ahead and working with the below process.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Segoe UI;">Note that this post is specifically about how I interview college candidates or candidates with a small number of years in the industry.&nbsp; I have a much different process for senior level developers (which is more of what I do these days). </span></p>
<h2>Pre Interview Setup</h2>
<p>The candidate deserves my undivided attention during the interview.&nbsp; Before I go out to greet the candidate I turn my phone off and put it in my desk, close my email, turn off the speakers to my computer and lock the screen.&nbsp; The only visible distraction I have is a clock to make sure I&rsquo;m keeping the interview moving along.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Introduction</h2>
<p>My very first goal in an interview is to make sure the candidate is comfortable in the environment. Interviewing is a nerve racking experience for some people (especially college candidates who are quite possibly doing this for the first time ever).&nbsp; I&rsquo;m rarely the first person on an interview loop and hence I often have to deal with candidates that are tired or perhaps rattled a bit by an interview earlier in the day.&nbsp; I find people perform best when they are in a relaxed environment and I do my best to get them there.</p>
<p>One technique I&rsquo;ve found that helps relax people is to get them talking about something they are passionate about.&nbsp; I get every candidates resume a day or two before the interview and I look over it in detail.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m looking for anything that they have put significant time or effort into: a senior project, GitHub contributions, stack overflow, etc &hellip;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once I find that project I spend 30 minutes or so researching it myself.&nbsp; My goal is to get enough of an understanding of the project that I can have a conversation about it.&nbsp; I also write down some really easy questions about the project.&nbsp; Presenting the candidate with questions on subjects they are passionate about is a good way to get the candidate relaxed and give them an early confidence boost.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s much better then starting them off with questions I&rsquo;m passionate about</p>
<p>I usually start off with the standard small talk.&nbsp; Who I am, how long I&rsquo;ve been here and what groups I&rsquo;ve worked in at Microsoft.&nbsp; I ask them the same about themselves and then transition into the research I&rsquo;ve done on them</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was looking over your resume and noticed your senior project on improving TCP startup.&nbsp; Tell me about that.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some people are happy to go on at length here and some are a bit more reserved.&nbsp; For the reserved I prompt them with the questions I&rsquo;ve already written down.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is TCP intentionally slow at startup?</p>
<p>Your project focused on improving algorithm X, what was wrong with it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember the goal here is to relax the candidate and increase their confidence.&nbsp; Take their project, craft easy questions for it based on the work their project said they did.&nbsp; Let them shine here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I generally reserve 10-15 minutes for this section of the interview</p>
<h2>The Technical Interview</h2>
<p>I start the technical portion off with a very easy and vaguely worded question.&nbsp; My favorite question is the following</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a function that takes a collection of letters and determines if there are any duplicate letters</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The candidate is free to constrain this problem however they like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can I use a hash table?&nbsp; Sure</p>
<p>Can I assume the letters are all ASCII? Sure</p>
<p>Can I assume they come in sorted order? Sure</p>
<p>Can I sort them? Sure</p>
<p>Can I use something like bubble sort to check every combination? Sure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do this for a couple of reason.&nbsp; In part I want to keep the candidate comfortable and give them an easy win on the white board.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care how they solve it, just that they can solve it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a modified fizzbuzz problem that tells me they can at least write code in the language of their choosing.&nbsp; The other reason I do this is because I&rsquo;m curious to see what questions they will ask (if they ask any).&nbsp; What they ask often reveals a good deal on how they approach coding.</p>
<p>After they get the solution correct and we walk through it I start taking things away.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That hash table makes it easy doesn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; How would you solve it without a hash table?</p>
<p>ASCII really makes the problem easy.&nbsp; How would you solve it with Unicode characters?</p>
<p>Could you solve this without allocating any memory?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I make subtle changes to the question that make the solution <strong>incrementally</strong> harder and gauge how they react to the changes.&nbsp; I do want to stress incrementally here.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t go from easy to hard with a single twist.&nbsp; Instead I add constraints to gradually and incrementally up the difficulty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not critical that they solve every twist I give them.&nbsp; Really what I&rsquo;m after here is how they think about coding and whether or not they can adapt their solution to changing requirements (aka my life as a programmer).&nbsp; I&rsquo;m also curious how they react on a personal level to the changes.&nbsp; Do they get angry, excited, etc &hellip;</p>
<p>Throughout this section of the interview there is one thing I&rsquo;m constantly vigilant about</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do <strong>not</strong> ever let the interview session go stale for more than 5-10 seconds</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is 0 value in having an interview where me and the candidate are just staring at each other silently for several minutes.&nbsp; If they get stuck on a problem it is my job as the interviewer is to help get them unstuck.&nbsp; Ask them what they&rsquo;re stuck on, what they&rsquo;ve considered, get them to draw out sample input, anything that gets them talking or writing on the white board.</p>
<p>My time reservation for this section is 35-40 minutes but I&rsquo;m a bit more flexible.&nbsp; If the candidate is a clear hire I usually stop earlier and spend more time on selling, answering questions.&nbsp; If a candidate is struggling I give them as much time as possible to get to a good solution.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Wrap Up Conversation</h2>
<p>In general I let the interview wrap up be very candidate driven.&nbsp; I open the floor for questions they have.&nbsp; If they don&rsquo;t have any I try and answer the most common questions</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the environment in my group like</li>
<li>What are the ups and downs of my group</li>
<li>What is life in Seattle like</li>
<li>Why did I pick Microsoft over company X</li>
</ul>
<p>It is really important in the wrap up to make sure the candidate leaves feeling good about the interview.&nbsp; Even if the candidate completely and utterly screwed up the interview I try to make sure they leave feeling good about the session.&nbsp; They could have just had a bad day, you may have just asked them the one question they couldn&rsquo;t answer.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very possible that you are the only &ldquo;No Hire&rdquo; they will get all day long.&nbsp; Or maybe they&rsquo;re not good enough now but a year from now they&rsquo;ve gotten enough better that they nail the interview and you end up working with them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To sum it up in one statement &hellip;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never let a candidate leave feeling bad about themselves.&nbsp;</p>
