<p>I just released version 0.5.0 of VsVim: a vim emulation editor extension for Visual Studio 2010 Beta1 written in F#.&nbsp; This is a hobby project I’ve been working on for awhile now.&nbsp; I expect to continue updating this release as time goes on as I use it on a daily basis and I’m interested in getting back feedback from users on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Link:&nbsp;<a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329">http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329</a>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Here’s a quick break down on the state of this project</p>  <p align="left"><b>Caveats and Expectations</b></p>  <p align="left">This extension is being released by me, not by Microsoft.&nbsp; As such the support level for this extension is equivalent to the amount of free time I have to put into it.&nbsp; </p>  <p><b>Quality Level</b></p>  <p>I would classify this as a Beta style release.&nbsp; I use this extension every day and I have a very large test bed to verify functionality.&nbsp; There are still several known bugs (detailed below) and little quirks I’m working on.&nbsp; But they are mostly minor issues</p>  <p><b>What’s Implemented</b></p>  <p>At this point the engine has an Insert, Normal and Command mode.&nbsp; </p>  <ul>   <li>     <div align="left">Insert Mode</div>      <ul>       <li>         <div align="left">Basic insertion layer which allows for typing.&nbsp; No special insert mode commands are implemented </div>       </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>     <div align="left">Normal Mode.</div>      <ul>       <li>Movement Commands: h,j,k,l,w,b,$,^,n,*,# </li>        <li>Edit Commands: x,X,d,p,P,A,u,&lt;,&gt;,o </li>        <li>Incremental Search </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>     <div align="left">Command Mode</div>      <ul>       <li>         <div align="left">:e</div>       </li>        <li>         <div align="left">Jump to line</div>       </li>        <li>         <div align="left">Beginning / end of line</div>       </li>     </ul>   </li> </ul>  <p align="left"><b>Deviations </b></p>  <p align="left">The biggest deviation I made from a traditional VIM engine is that I am using .Net regular expressions instead of VIM style regular expressions.&nbsp; This allowed me to focus on getting a lot of features written vs. spending time building a regular expression engine.&nbsp; Getting this working will be a focus of a later release.&nbsp; </p>  <p align="left">Another issue is the cursor.&nbsp; As flexible as the new editor is, one part that is very tricky is changing the appearance of the cursor.&nbsp; So making a block style cursor for normal mode was not done for this release.&nbsp; Instead I simply color the cursor red for normal mode and black for insert mode.&nbsp; This will be fixed in a later release.</p>  <p align="left"><b>Bugs</b></p>  <p align="left">Below is the list of known issues for the extension.&nbsp; I’ve noted all bugs for which I cannot get a steady repro.&nbsp; If you can find one I would appreciate you emailing the steps to me.&nbsp; </p>  <ul>   <li>     <div align="left">Cursor appearance in normal mode is not a block cursor but instead a red cursor </div>   </li>    <li>Need Repro: Using ‘o’ in normal mode can cause the line ending to switch from \r\n to \r or \n. </li>    <li>     <div align="left">Both ‘#’ and ‘*’ match partial words instead of full words</div>   </li>    <li>     <div align="left">Register list is limited to standard a-z alphabet </div>   </li> </ul>  <p align="left"><b>What’s next?</b></p>  <p align="left">Thus far I’ve been working on features which don’t conflict with existing Visual Studio key bindings.&nbsp; The next big release will be focusing on the infrastructure needed to integrate these commands smoothly into the core Vim engine and Visual Studio itself.&nbsp; This will allow me to expand the number of implemented features a great deal.&nbsp; </p>  <p align="left"><b>Where’s the source?</b></p>  <p align="left">Should be released soon.&nbsp; Right now I’m working out where I should host this project long term.&nbsp; Preferably a place where users can file bugs and leave feedback.&nbsp; </p>  <p align="left"><br></p>  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  <p align="left"></p></div>
