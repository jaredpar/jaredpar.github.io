Several people have asked on the newsgroups about a good method to bind a list
of items to entries in a ToolStripDropDown instance.  I've run into this issue
a couple of times and wanted to share some sample code.

The class takes in a ToolStripDropDown instance.  You can then set the data
source to any IEnumerable collection.  Whenever the data in the list changes,
call ReloadFromSource().  Or alternately, if the list implements IBindingList
then it will automatically update.

    
    
    Imports System.ComponentModel


    


    Public Class DropDownBinding


        Private m_dd As ToolStripDropDown


        Private m_list As IEnumerable


        Private m_bindingList As IBindingList


    


        Public Sub New(ByVal dd As ToolStripDropDown)


            m_dd = dd


            m_list = New List(Of Object)()


        End Sub


    


        Public Sub SetDataSource(ByVal e As IEnumerable)


            If Not m_bindingList Is Nothing Then


                RemoveHandler m_bindingList.ListChanged, New ListChangedEventHandler(AddressOf Me.OnListChanged)


            End If


    


            m_bindingList = TryCast(e, IBindingList)


            m_list = e


    


            If Not m_bindingList Is Nothing Then


                AddHandler m_bindingList.ListChanged, New ListChangedEventHandler(AddressOf Me.OnListChanged)


            End If


    


            RebuildList()


        End Sub


    


        Public Sub ReloadFromSource()


            RebuildList()


        End Sub


    


        Private Sub OnListChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As ListChangedEventArgs)


            RebuildList()


        End Sub


    


        Private Sub RebuildList()


            m_dd.Items.Clear()


    


            For Each cur As Object In m_list


                m_dd.Items.Add(cur.ToString())


            Next


        End Sub


    End Class
