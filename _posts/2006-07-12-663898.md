After working a little over 2 years with the VSTS Architect SKU I've decide to
take on a new role at Microsoft.  I am taking a job with the Visual Basic Core
Compiler team.  This is an exciting oppuritunity for me to get back to a lot
of the topics I worked with in college.  Expect me to be showing up with more
regularity on VB newsgroups and forums.

The transition occurred just over a month ago but I've been too busy to put an
announcement on my blog until now.
