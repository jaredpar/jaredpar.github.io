This is a little off topic from my typical purely technical discussion.

I'm a huge advocate of automated code verification.  Unit testing is preferred
but really any method is acceptable as long as it gets the job done of testing
your code.  IMHO, testing is the most important part of a developers job.

Besides the 3 or 4 projects I am doing as part of my job at Microsoft, I work
on **numerous** side projects.  Most of these come in the form of tools,
libraries or little fun gadgets.  These are written in a variety of languages;
C#, VB, C++, Powershell Script, etc ...

This is pretty common amongst many devs I know.  We love our job and code
before, during and after work.  Some of the devs I know don't bother
automating testing of any of their tools.  When asked they generally respond
that it's not worth it.

  
I disagree strongly for certain types of tools.  For tools and libraries I own
that I expect long term usage on, I test methodically.  On any given day I may
update a couple of the tools.  The only item that adds sanity to the situation
is testing.  This allows me to respond quickly to customer requests for
features, bug fixes, etc  and get quick verification that I haven't introduced
a regression.
