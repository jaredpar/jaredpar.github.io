I just released an update to VsVim for Visual Studio 2010 Beta2. This should be available shortly from the extension manager in Visual Studio or it can be downloaded directly at the following link

**Changes**

This is mainly a minor bug fix release. Primarily there was a bug in the command mode jump implementation that made it flaky in big buffers.  Additionally I implemented the normal mode commands r and O.

**Source Code**

Source for this release is available at the following location. It is released under the [MS-PL](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc707818.aspx).

**The usual caveats and expectations**

This extension is being released by me, not by Microsoft. As such the support level for this extension is equivalent to the amount of free time I have to put into it.
