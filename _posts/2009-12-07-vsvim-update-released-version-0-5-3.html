<p>I just released an update to VsVim for Visual Studio 2010 Beta2.&#160; This should be available shortly from the extension manager in Visual Studio or it can be downloaded directly at the following link</p>  <p>Link: <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329">http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329</a></p>  <p><strong>Changes</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>     <p>Normal Mode Block Cursor</p>      <p>This removes the red cursor in favor of a Vim block style cursor for normal mode. This is implemented as a simple adornment in the editor and in the end required much less work than I anticipated (also allowed the removal of a lot of hacky code).&#160; Thanks a lot to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/noahric/">Noah</a> for helping me out here. </p>   </li>    <li>     <p>Basic range support in command mode.</p>      <p>Currently limited to line number ranges, % and . (current line) </p>   </li>    <li>     <p>Command Mode Infrastructure Changes</p>      <p>This infrastructure change allowed my to correctly implement the few command mode commands I previously supported and laid the ground work for quick support of new commands</p>   </li>    <li>     <p>New Normal Mode Commands: gJ</p>   </li> </ul>  <p>This release is small on features and ordinarily wouldn’t qualify for an update.&#160; But the cursor change was so pleasant for myself that I decided to release a quick update just for that.&#160; </p>  <p><strong>What’s Next?</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Add command mode support for all normal mode commands that have a command mode equivalent</li>    <li>Resolve normal mode edits around a selection.&#160; Currently selection is ignored and it produces unexpected behavior.&#160; </li>    <li>More normal mode commands: In particular, Delete, gt, gT, global mark navigation </li>    <li>Lifetime issues around buffers and Vim’s internal object model</li>    <li>Navigation in a buffer which contains multiple font sizes</li> </ul>  <p><strong>The usual caveats and expectations</strong></p>  <p>This extension is being released by me, not by Microsoft.&#160; As such the support level for this extension is equivalent to the amount of free time I have to put into it.</p></div>
