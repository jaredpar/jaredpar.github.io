<p>Thanks to everyone who showed up at the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jaredpar/archive/2008/10/23/presenting-at-net-developers-association-meeting-oct-27.aspx">presentation on monday</a>.&#160; For those interested, I've uploaded the contents of the presentation <a href="http://cid-dc25b20f65f628f8.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/Public/Linq%20Presentation">here</a>.&#160; </p>  <p>I was unable to upload the large DB file used during the demo due to size limitations (sky drive will only let me upload a 50 MB file).&#160; But better than wasting both mine and your bandwidth, I included the script used to generate the db file.&#160; </p>  <p>The file is a powershell script named GenerateDb.ps1.&#160; If you pass the -argLarge switch, it will generate the 120MB demo file.</p>  <p>PS&gt;.\GenerateDb.ps1 -argLarge</p></div>
