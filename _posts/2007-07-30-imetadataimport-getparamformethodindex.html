<p>While investigating a recent bug I found about an interesting return for GetParamForMethodIndex.&nbsp; On a perfectly verifiable assembly, a call to GetParamForMethodIndex was returning a failure code.&nbsp;After some searching I found the return code was&nbsp;CLDB_E_RECORD_NOTFOUND. I was surprised at first because it's a verifiable assembly so how could the record for a parameter I knew existed not be there?</p> <p>It turns out this is legal.&nbsp; GetParamForMethodIndex returns a mdParamDef token by which you can query for information about a parameter with GetParamProps.&nbsp; This will return the following information about a parameter.&nbsp; </p> <ul> <li>Name of the parameter</li> <li>Attributes about the param (ByRef, Marshal, etc ...)</li> <li>Default value</li></ul> <p>In this particular case the assembly was generated without a parameter name.&nbsp; As it also had none of the information the parameter row was omitted from the metadata.&nbsp; The reason is adding an empty row takes up space and provides no data.&nbsp; </p> <p>Note you can't reproduce this behavior with ILASM.exe.&nbsp; If you omit a parameter name, ILASM.exe will add one for you and hence generate a parameter row. </p></div>
