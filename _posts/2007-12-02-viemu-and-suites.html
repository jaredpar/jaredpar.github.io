<p><a href="http://www.viemu.com/">ViEmu</a> is a Visual Studio Package which adds Vim keybinding support into Visual Studio.&#160; For former VI users this is huge benefit as I can use all of my cryptic key combinations inside of Visual Studio.</p>  <p>For those unfamiliar, Vi is one of the original editors for the Unix operating systems.&#160; Vim (VI iMproved) is a set of improvements on the original Vi editor.&#160; At it's core Vi/Vim is a modal editor which means that it has multiple modes of input.&#160; Mainly there are </p>  <ol>   <li>Command - allows you to enter commands to the editor</li>    <li>Edit -modifying the text</li> </ol>  <p>Getting started with Vi/Vim is quite a challenge because the learning curve is incredibly steep.&#160; Once you get it down though you can accomplish a whole lot more with just a few key strokes.&#160; ViEmu brings this power into Visual Studio.</p>  <p>The only downside is that ViEmu dramatically alters the way keystrokes affect the environment.&#160; This is a really interferes when I need to run code suites on my machine as it will cause any that use keystrokes to fail.&#160; </p>  <p>Again, PowerShell is the answer.&#160; I just disable ViEmu while suites are running on my machine and quickly re-enable them afterwards.&#160; </p>  <p>function Enable-ViEmu()   <br />{    <br />&#160;&#160;&#160; sp &quot;hkcu:\software\microsoft\VisualStudio\9.0\ViEmu&quot; &quot;Enable&quot; 1     <br />&#160;&#160;&#160; sp &quot;hkcu:\software\microsoft\VisualStudio\9.0\ViEmu&quot; &quot;AllowKbdClashes&quot; 0     <br />} </p>  <p>function Disable-ViEmu()   <br />{    <br />&#160;&#160;&#160; sp &quot;hkcu:\software\microsoft\VisualStudio\9.0\ViEmu&quot; &quot;Enable&quot; 0     <br />&#160;&#160;&#160; sp &quot;hkcu:\software\microsoft\VisualStudio\9.0\ViEmu&quot; &quot;AllowKbdClashes&quot; 1     <br />}</p>  <p>ViEmu provides this UI but it's a mode switch.&#160; I tend to run my suites from the command line and I find opening the UI and disabling takes too much time and is a distraction.&#160; Running a quick disable-viemu takes virtually no time and fits right into the command line.</p></div>
