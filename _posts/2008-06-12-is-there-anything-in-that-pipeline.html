<p>One operation I frequently perform is use a powershell pipeline to filter out a large set of data.&nbsp; Typically I don't care what is in the result but rather is there actually anything left in the pipeline.&nbsp; I can't find a good powershell built-in to perform this task so I use the following filter.</p> <p>function Test-Any() {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; begin {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $any = $false<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; process {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $any = $true<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; end {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $any<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>} <p>Now I can easily write </p> <p>$any = Some-Command | ?{ Some-Condition } | test-any</p></div>
