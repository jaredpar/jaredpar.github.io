<DIV>I spent a bit of my college days in *nix land.&nbsp; Much of that time was spent writing and maintaining scripts for my various shell accounts.&nbsp; After I switched to primarily developing on Windows, I was frustrated by the Windows CMD shell and eventually lost interest in scripting.&nbsp;</DIV>

<DIV>Lately I've been playing with Monad at work and it's revived my interest.&nbsp; It takes a few minutes to get used to the new noun-verb command structure but once you do it's extremely powerful and fun to use.&nbsp; I am looking forward to writing some commandlets once I have a few spare cycles.&nbsp; Until then just interesting scripts.</DIV>
