<p>Another day, another PowerShell feature discovered.&#160; Unfortunately this time it was a feature that made me think I had a bug in my script.&#160; The script read through some directories, did some file parsing and created a data object for every directory in the form of a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jaredpar/archive/2007/11/29/tuples-in-powershell.aspx">Tuple</a>.&#160; </p>  <p>One of the files was People.txt and contained a list of relevant people for the data (one per line).&#160; Unfortunately the parameter kept showing up like so ...</p>  <p>People   <br />------    <br />{People.txt, People.txt, People.txt, People.txt}</p>  <p>Confusion set in as to what I did wrong since the code in question amounted to the following.</p>  <p>D:\temp&gt; new-tuple &quot;People&quot;,(gc People.txt)</p>  <p>Next step is manual verification</p>  <p>D:\temp&gt; gc People.txt   <br />jared    <br />jamie    <br />jason    <br />mary</p>  <p>So far so good.&#160; Then a tried the explicit tuple code and got back the People.txt problem.&#160; Eventually I decided to try out get-member and see exactly what I had in the array.&#160; It was a string type as expected but then I noticed the following ... extra items.</p>  <p>D:\temp&gt; gc People.txt | gm </p>  <p>&#160;&#160; TypeName: System.String </p>  <p>Name&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; MemberType&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Definition   <br />----&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; ----------&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; ----------    <br />...</p>  <p>PSParentPath&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; NoteProperty&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; System.String PSParentPath=D:\temp   <br />PSPath&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; NoteProperty&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; System.String PSPath=D:\temp\People.txt    <br />PSProvider&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; NoteProperty&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; System.Management.Automation.Provider...    <br />ReadCount&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; NoteProperty&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; System.Int64 ReadCount=1    <br /></p>  <p>It turns out that when you read information from a file in PowerShell they will handily add in the file information as NoteProperty instances.&#160; All well and good and I can see where that would be useful but for now it's really messing up my display.&#160; To remove it just tell powershell that I really just want a string.</p>  <p>D:\temp&gt; new-tuple &quot;People&quot;,(gc People.txt | %{[string]$_}) </p>  <p>People   <br />------    <br />{jared, jamie, jason, mary}</p></div>
