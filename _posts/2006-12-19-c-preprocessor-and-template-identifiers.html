<P>A couple of hours of tracking down a compiler error a couple of days ago taught me something about the preprocessor I'd like to pass on so others can avoid the ... learning :).&nbsp; </P>
<P>I kept getting confronted by "constant expression must be followed by a ,". Not the exact error but in the right range. This was a bit annoying because the error occurred on a simple template. Something along the lines of the following</P><PRE>template&lt;typename T1, typename T2&gt; 
struct Foo
{
  ...
}
</PRE>
<P>The long and short of it is the C/C++ processor will replace any word in a file if there is a corresponding macro with the same name.&nbsp; This I knew from years of programming.&nbsp; Every now and again you learn something new though.&nbsp; The preprocessor will also try and expand template identifier's.&nbsp; Normally this isn't a problem if the macro is just defined to another simple value.&nbsp; For example, the below <I>usually</I> won't cause you a headache</P><PRE>#define KEY KEY2

template &lt;class KEY&gt;
class Pair
{
  ...
};
</PRE>
<P>However if you try something fancy like the following, bad things start to happen</P><PRE>#define KEY (KEY+2)
</PRE>
<P>T1 was not the actual template identifier but it was a rather obscure word. Some other header file being include was defining it to some complex macro. At the end of the day, I switched the template definition header file to be included first and to thus avoid the macro problem. I also added a few #define/#error combinations so that an error would occur if they were included in the wrong order</P><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>
