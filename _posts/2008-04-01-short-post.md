In an effort to post more often and with greater effect, I've been trying to divide my posts into short, targeted posts and longer in depth posts.  Thus far my short posts aren't nearly as short as I'd like them to be and end up being much closer to my in depth postings in length.

In order to better hit this goal today will be a short post.

Happy April Fools Day!
