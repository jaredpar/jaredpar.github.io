While I was looking into CAS changes in 2.0 I found some very good news about
thread changes in 2.0.  In .NET 2.0 both Thread.CurrentPrincipal and the
Thread Impersonation token are now propagated amongst threads including
ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem.  The latter was a great pain to developers in
.NET 1.0 particularly because Thread.CurrentPrincipal did not propagate and it
created a lot of funny code to deal with the CAS impacts.

This MSDN article delves into these changes.
