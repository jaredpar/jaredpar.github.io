<p>I published a .Net utility library on <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com">Code Gallery</a> today called <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/BclExtras">BclExtras</a>.&#160; It’s a set of classes meant to be used in addition to the standard .Net base class libraries (BCL).&#160; The main focuses of the library are functional programming, multi-threading, LINQ extensions, unit testing and API’s designed to support type inference.</p>  <p>This project evolved from various classes and constructs I was using in personal projects.&#160; For the last year or so I’ve kept as a separate tested library.&#160; It started out with a lot of multi-threaded code constructs but lately is leaning to a lot of functional style API’s and collections.&#160; </p>  <p>The library includes source and binaries for .Net 2.0 and .Net 3.5.&#160; The .Net 2.0 version of the library includes many constructs added in 3.5 that don’t rely on any 2.0SP1 CLR features.&#160; Examples are Func&lt;T&gt;, Action&lt;T&gt;, the Extension attribute and a subset of the LINQ Enumerable class.&#160; It allows for most LINQ expressions in a 2.0 targeted application. These types are removed in the 3.5 version to avoid conflicts with types in System.Core.&#160; </p>  <p>I’ve previously released this library under the name <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/RantPack">RantPack</a>.&#160; It originally started out as personal utility library of mine and hence ended up with the somewhat obscure name.&#160; But, besides to me, RantPack doesn’t really convey a useful meaning.&#160; So I decided to give it a more meaningful name for the general population.&#160; </p></div>
