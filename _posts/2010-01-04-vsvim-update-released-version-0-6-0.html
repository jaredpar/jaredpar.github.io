<p>I just released an update to VsVim for Visual Studio 2010 Beta2.&#160; This should be available shortly from the extension manager in Visual Studio or it can be downloaded directly at the following link</p>  <p>Link: <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329">http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329</a></p>  <p><strong>New Features</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Normal Mode Commands: Y,Delete, Arrow Keys, gP, gp, z&lt;CR&gt;,zt, z., zz, z-, zb</li>    <li>Command Mode Commands: d[elete], &lt;,&gt;, j[oin], y[ank], p[ut], </li>    <li>Insert Mode: Fixed Intellisense window dismissal issue (see below)</li> </ul>  <p><strong>Notable Bug Fixes</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>In previous versions intellisense didn’t play well with insert mode.&#160; In particular attempting to dismiss intellisense with the Escape key would exit insert mode but leave intellisense showing.&#160; This release fixes the behavior to instead dismiss intellisense and leave you in Insert Mode</li>    <li>Normal Mode O now enters insert mode upon completion</li>    <li>Count was not being applied to certain edit commands (x) in Normal Mode</li>    <li>Normal Mode “dw” was deleting the line break if the word was at the end of the line </li> </ul>  <p><strong>Source Code</strong></p>  <p>Source for this release is available at the following location.&#160; It is released under the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc707818.aspx">MS-PL</a>. </p>  <p><a title="http://cid-dc25b20f65f628f8.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/Public/VsVim/VsVim-0.6.0.zip" href="http://cid-dc25b20f65f628f8.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/Public/VsVim/VsVim-0.6.0.zip">http://cid-dc25b20f65f628f8.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/Public/VsVim/VsVim-0.6.0.zip</a></p>  <p><strong>Future Plans</strong></p>  <p>The next planned major update is version 0.7.0.&#160; The two main features of this release will be the addition of Visual Mode and the :substitute command.&#160; Additionally I plan to flesh out a lot of the areas in normal, command and visual mode.&#160; </p>  <p><strong>The usual caveats and expectations</strong></p>  <p>This extension is being released by me, not by Microsoft.&#160; As such the support level for this extension is equivalent to the amount of free time I have to put into it.</p></div>
