Time again to learn a new language. I enjoy picking up a new language every
now and again. It's a great way to branch out your skill set and usually
leads to new programming techniques in languages that are a part of
professional or hobby life.

But why bother' The popular languages have a lot of common elements :
functions, types, etc ... With all of the common elements what can learning a
new language really give you?

It's true that there are a lot of common elements (especially for .Net based
languages). But what really interests me are the features which make the
individual language extremely productive. Most languages have a feature or
two that really makes it worth learning. They greatly increase the
productivity of the developer. Often full libraries are designed around these
features. For instance

  * C++ and?? Templates 
    * This is somewhat special in that it's extraordinarily powerful for both good and evil 
  * VB and late binding 
  * C# and iterators 

What's great about learning these features is I can often import them into my
current heavily used languages. For instance, even though C#/VB don't
directly support functional style programming, I've spent a bit of time over
the last few months building libraries that make it fairly easy to incorporate
them into either language. This added a deal of flexibility into my programs
and a real functional feel.

Lately I've been focusing on immutable/persistant data structures, lambda
expressions and tuples. This makes F# a natural choice for a language to
learn. While I tend to program in a somewhat functional style this will be
the first functional language I've heavily invested my time in. For awhile I
did a bit of Haskell but nothing serious.

I intend to blog about the joys and not so joyful moments of this process.
