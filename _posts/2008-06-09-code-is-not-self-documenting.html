<p>Nothing revolutionary about that statement.&#160; Yet I keep reading the opposite on various comment threads and message boards so I thought it a good idea to explore it again.</p>  <p>Code is not self documenting.</p>  <p>The &quot;code is self document&quot; argument often comes up when commenting conventions, patterns and overall usage is discussed.&#160; People who are typically against writing more than the existing set of comments will throw out the argument &quot;if we need a comment then the code should be written to be self documenting.&quot;&#160; </p>  <p>To at extent I agree with this.&#160; Code should not be obfuscated and the usage should be clear.&#160; I personally strive to make my implementations as clear as possible and enforce that belief on anyone who asks me for a code review.&#160; </p>  <p>Yet while you can write code so that an individual algorithm or function is close to self documenting you cannot write it in such a way that it will explain it's greater purpose in a program.&#160; Only comments can do that.&#160; Self describing code can only describe itself, not it's purpose in the bigger picture.&#160; </p>  <p>Comments serve to both 1) explain the algorithm and 2) explain the greater purpose of the algorithm in the program.</p>  <p>Yet people still cling to the code is self documenting mantra.&#160; In my experience there are several reasons for this belief.&#160;&#160; The first is that people have only worked on projects small enough that for most purposes they can be kept entirely in their mind [*].&#160; Until you work on a big enough program #2 is not even a factory because you intimately understand how every function fits into the big picture.&#160; </p>  <p>Another is that they have never worked on a project with people they weren't very familiar with.&#160; People you don't know well or have worked with before will likely have different ways and practices of approaching a problem which you have not encountered before.&#160; What is obvious to them won't be obvious to you.&#160; The bridge between these approaches are comments.</p>  <p>I've seen DRY (don't repeat yourself) brought up as well [**].&#160; The code clearly says what it does so adding a comment is just repeating yourself.&#160; I find that to be patently untrue.&#160; If we're even having the conversation then the code is clearly not self documenting.&#160; Also in the cases when an individual function is documenting you will still run into #2.&#160; </p>  <p>Commenting your code benefits both people who are reading your code and yourself.&#160; You will eventually come to a point where you've forgotten what a particular piece of code did or how it fit into your bigger program.&#160; Your comments will save you.</p>  <pre>[*] The temptation to say &quot;kept in memory&quot; here was huge but I avoided it.
[**] In general I think that DRY is a great approach to programming but I feel it's being taken to far here</pre></div>
