<p>I was playing around in the registry the other day and found the PowerShell API lacking in a key area.&#160; There does not appear to be a good way to detect the presence of a Registry Name/Value pair.&#160; All of the operations such as New, Delete, Rename are based off of the program knowing the presence or absence of the key before hand.&#160; This lacks symmetry with the rest of the APIs which have a test style function.&#160; </p>  <pre>PS&gt; test-path &quot;some\file\path\data.txt&quot;
True</pre>

<p>I took a few minutes and sketched out a basic Test-ItempProperty function.&#160; It utilizes the Get-ItemProperty function and suppresses the rather loud red font error message via the â€“ErrorAction parameter (standard on all CmdLets).&#160; </p>

<pre>function Test-ItemProperty() {
    param ( [string]$path = $(throw &quot;Need a path&quot;),
            [string]$name = $(throw &quot;Need a name&quot;) )

    $temp = $null
    $temp = Get-ItemProperty -path $path -name $name -errorAction SilentlyContinue
    return $temp -ne $null
}</pre>

<p>Now I can finish up my happy scripting for the night</p>

<pre>PS&gt; test-path . IsItScriptingTime
True</pre></div>
