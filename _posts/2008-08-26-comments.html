<p>If only people spent as much time writing comments as they did speaking to the evils of comments.&#160; Everything from useless, inaccurate, to many comments make code unreadable, you should code better ... etc.&#160; </p>  <p>I haven't ever looked at a piece of code and thought &quot;wow, way too many comments&quot; or &quot;that code would be beautiful if it weren't for the comments.&quot;</p>  <p>Do the next guy a favor, comment your code.&#160; </p></div>
