<p>Debugging PowerShell can be extremely frustrating because it often turns into a session of debugging your own thought process.&nbsp; Often when I hit a PowerShell script issue I find myself feeling like everything is right and I'm just missing something basic.&nbsp; IMHO, this is because I spend the majority of my day programming in compiled languages and don't completely come out of that box when I'm programming in PowerShell.</p> <p>For instance the other day I added one of Lee Holme's scripts to my default profile.&nbsp; The script is used to create a Generic object inside of PowerShell.</p> <p><a title="http://www.leeholmes.com/blog/CreatingGenericTypesInPowerShell.aspx" href="http://www.leeholmes.com/blog/CreatingGenericTypesInPowerShell.aspx">http://www.leeholmes.com/blog/CreatingGenericTypesInPowerShell.aspx</a></p> <p>The syntax is very clean.&nbsp; It is the same as new-object but requires the additional type parameters. </p><pre>$PS&gt;new-genericobject Collections.Generic.List int
$PS&gt;
</pre>
<p>The only problem was I couldn't get the script to return an object.&nbsp; I tried a couple of operations like passing the output to get-member and seeing what exactly I was creating.&nbsp; I kept getting errors like "No object has been specified ...".&nbsp; My mind kept saying "It's there, it's non-null, why doesn't it have any members!!!".&nbsp; </p>
<p>Frustrated I turned to some internal aliases and eventually Lee helped me out.&nbsp; Nothing above is in error.&nbsp; The problem is PowerShell will unroll collection classes.&nbsp; In this case I've created an empty collection so there is nothing to output or pass to get-member.&nbsp;&nbsp; My issues is that I kept thinking it terms of compiled languages instead of PowerShell's collection unrolling semantics (which I will add, I quite like).&nbsp; </p>
<p>Sadly any other object creating would have quickly lead me to this solution </p><pre>C:\Users\jaredpar\winconfig\PowerShell&gt; new-genericobject collections.generic.Ke

</pre>
<p>Another way to figure out this problem would be to bypass the collection unrolling in pipelines and directly specify the object to get-member.</p><pre>C:\Users\jaredpar\winconfig\PowerShell&gt; gm -inputobject $col
