<p>Recently the MSDN blog architecture got a long overdue update to a new infrastructure.&#160; Most of these changes are very welcome but a few are causing a bit of issues for me and readers </p>  <ul>   <li>My blog URL changed to - <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jaredpar/">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jaredpar/</a></li>    <li>Additionally my RSS feed changed to - <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jaredpar/rss.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jaredpar/rss.aspx</a></li>    <li>Several of my recent posts were deleted during the upgrade.&#160; I will be reposting them today but they will unfortunately re-appear in your RSS reader</li> </ul>  <p>All of the old URLâ€™s should continue to work for the foreseeable future.&#160; But I imagine at some point the redirects will be removed so please take a minute and update your readers.&#160; </p><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>
