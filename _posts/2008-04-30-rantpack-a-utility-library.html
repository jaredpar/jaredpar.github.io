<P>I often post code examples, samples and snippets on this blog.&nbsp; Many of these samples are a part of a utility library I've been writing and maintaining for many years now.&nbsp; Essentially since I got involved in DotNet programming.</P>
<P>I write a lot of code for&nbsp;internal apps, demos&nbsp;and hobby projects.&nbsp; Having a utility library to tote around with me greatly increases my impact in a project because it gives me a place to put common code that I would otherwise have to repeatedly cut and paste into projects.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Whenever I work on something I think the community at large would benefit from I try to blog about it.&nbsp; Unfortunately for the more complex samples blogging is not always easy.&nbsp; Complex structures don't really fit on a blog and often utilities depend on utilities and it forces users to cut and paste between multiple blog entries.&nbsp; Not good. </P>
<P>Now with <A href="http://code.msdn.com/" mce_href="http://code.msdn.com">http://code.msdn.com</A> I have a forum to fully share the items I've been working on.&nbsp; This is the perfect place to share code for the community and helps avoid the messiness of cutting and pasting blog posts.&nbsp; As such I've released my Library, <A href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/RantPack" mce_href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/RantPack">RantPack</A>, on Code Gallery.&nbsp; This includes both binaries and sources and is covered under the <A href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/RantPack/Project/License.aspx" mce_href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/RantPack/Project/License.aspx">Microsoft Public License</A>.</P>
<P>RantPack is available at <A title=http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/RantPack href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/RantPack" mce_href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/RantPack">http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/RantPack</A></P>
<P>A couple of notes on the sample. This is mainly for education and sharing purposes.&nbsp; The goal of this library is to make developing software faster and more reliable.&nbsp; It includes, but is not limited to </P>
<UL>
<LI>Functional Programming Patterns</LI>
<UL>
<LI>Tuples</LI>
<LI>Immutable/Persistent collections</LI></UL>
<LI>Threading </LI>
<UL>
<LI>Futures</LI>
<LI>Active Objects</LI>
<LI>Various other primitives</LI></UL>
<LI>General Patterns</LI>
<LI>General Utilities</LI></UL>
<P>Another item you will find browsing the sources are tests.&nbsp; Lots and lots of tests.&nbsp; At the time of this writing there are around 400 some odd unit tests on the library.&nbsp; There is nothing more frustrating than a utility library that doesn't work.&nbsp; As such I rigorously test the code I write. </P>
<P>Although I performance test much of my code and it performs great in the applications I use it for I'm sure there are a few cases I missed.&nbsp; Please feel free to point this out to me and I'll look into them.</P>
<P>Why the name RantPack?&nbsp; My blog is Rantings of a programmer and it's a pack of code :)</P></div>
