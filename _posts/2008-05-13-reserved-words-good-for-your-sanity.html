<p>Paul Vick <a href="http://www.panopticoncentral.net/archive/2008/05/08/23317.aspx">posted</a> a recent entry exploring the necessity, or lack there of, for having reserved words in a programming language.&nbsp; It's an interesting mental exercise to go through.&nbsp; At the end you'll realize that many reserved keywords aren't needed from the perspective of the compiler.&nbsp; This is part of the reason C# and VB are defaulting more to contextual keywords in recent releases.&nbsp; What the blog post didn't really talk about though was the programmer.&nbsp; From the programmer's perspective there is one great reason for reserved words.</p> <p>Sanity.</p> <p>Going through legacy code is hard enough already.&nbsp; Reserved words at least allow you to mentally structure the code you are looking at.&nbsp; If there was open season on the use of keywords you know someone will take advantage and flat out abuse the system.&nbsp; Can you imagine digging through some legacy C++ and seeing the following [1]</p><pre>class int : public new { public: new private; }
new void() {
  int int = new new;
  int.private = int;
  return int;
}</pre>
<p>Reading that makes my head hurt.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Having reserved words is a language adds a modicum of structure.&nbsp; Language structure allows developers to more quickly grasp the meaning and intent of a piece of code.&nbsp; Can you imagine trying to grasp a more complex example?&nbsp; Now imagine the programmer had several thousand lines of undocumented code with this pattern.&nbsp; Not fun.&nbsp; </p>
<p>[1] Yes I realize that making new/int non-reserved words may not be possible in C++.&nbsp; But this is just a hypothetical example.</p></div>
