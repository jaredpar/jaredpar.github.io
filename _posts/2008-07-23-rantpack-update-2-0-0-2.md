Version 2.0.0.2 released.

Summary: RantPack is a utility library I maintain and actively use.  The main
themes of this library are functional programming, patterns,
immutable/pressitent collections, future and other threading primitives.  I've
placed the code and binaries on <http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/RantPack> for
educational and sharing purposes.
