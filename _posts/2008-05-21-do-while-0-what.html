<P>A recent check in of mine raised a few eye brows during reviews.&nbsp; I checked in a few macros which ended with/contained a "do{}while(0)" and people were curious as to why.&nbsp; </P>
<P>In my experience there are two main uses for it.&nbsp; </P>
<OL>
<LI>Insert an empty statement with no runtime penalty </LI>
<LI>Group a set of statements into a single statement followable by a semi-colon</LI>
<OL>
<LI>do { Func1(); Func2() } while(0) </LI></OL></OL>
<P>Macros are mutating little constructs which jump back and forth depending on the compile time options.&nbsp; Many macros compile to different expressions based on the options and in some cases they compile to nothing.&nbsp; This is where #1 really comes in hand.&nbsp; Imagine you have the following code.&nbsp; </P><PRE>  if(someCondition)
    MY_MACRO();</PRE>
<P>Compiling MY_MACRO to nothing will cause at the least a compile time warning since you will have essentially if(someCondition);. Instead you can use the do{}while(0) trick.</P><PRE>#if CONST_1
#define MY_MACRO() Func1()
#else
#define MY_MACRO() do{}while(0)</PRE>
<P>Another us is for stylistic reasons.&nbsp; Some camps don't believe a ; should be used as a empty statement and use do{}while(0) instead.&nbsp; I tend to agree.&nbsp; Mainly because one of my early C professors had the same belief.&nbsp; The habit stuck around.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Update: Changed incorrect use of word expression -&gt; single statement </P></div>
