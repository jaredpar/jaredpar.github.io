<p>For a time I've been avoiding extension methods.&nbsp; Not because I'm opposed to using them but because of the 3.5 Framework.&nbsp; </p> <p>A lot of the tools I own are designed to be very light weight tools that only require the user to have 2.0 installed on their machine.&nbsp; I find that the easier that tools are to install, the more likely people are to use them.&nbsp; </p> <p>Extension methods require the ExtensionAttribute be available.&nbsp; Since the attribute is declared in a 3.5 Framework assembly it's not possible to use extension methods without the 3.5 framework.&nbsp; At least, that's what I thought up until I read an recent MSDN article.</p> <p>You can simply define the ExtensionAttribute in your assembly and extension methods will start working.&nbsp; No references to the 3.5 framework required.&nbsp; It's a lightweight solution that adds the full power of extension methods to your program.</p><pre class="code"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,255)">Namespace</span> System.Runtime.CompilerServices
