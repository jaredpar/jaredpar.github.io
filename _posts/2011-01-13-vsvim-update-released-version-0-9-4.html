<p>I just released an update to VsVim for Visual Studio 2010.&#160; This is available on the extension manager in Visual Studio or can be downloaded directly at the following link.</p>  <p>Link: <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329">http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329</a></p>  <p>GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim">http://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim</a></p>  <p>This update includes the following</p>  <ul>   <li>R# 5.1 Support </li>    <li>Snippet Support</li>    <li>Many fixes to key mapping</li>    <li>And of course many bug fixes</li> </ul>  <p>I do want to take a second and thank <a href="https://github.com/MartinLemburg">Martin Lemburg</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rride">rride</a> for the many detailed issues they filed during the 0.9.3 release.&#160; It really helps to have such great feedback to work against.</p>  <p><strong>Future Plans</strong></p>  <p>I’m aiming for 0.9.5 to be a 3 week release cycle.&#160; It will expand the third party editor support to include DevExpress / CodeRush support and clean up many of the existing bugs.&#160; After that we’ll be pushing hard to get 1.0 out the door.&#160; </p>  <p><strong>The usual caveats and expectations</strong></p>  <p>This extension is being released by me, not by Microsoft.&#160; As such the support level for this extension is equivalent to the amount of free time I have to put into it.</p>  <p>Source for this release is available on the <a href="http://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim">GitHub project site</a>.&#160; It and the associated binaries are released under the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc707818.aspx">MS-PL</a>.</p><div style="clear:both;"></div></div>
