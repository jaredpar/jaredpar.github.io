If only people spent as much time writing comments as they did speaking to the
evils of comments.?? Everything from useless, inaccurate, to many comments make
code unreadable, you should code better ... etc.

I haven't ever looked at a piece of code and thought "wow, way too many
comments" or "that code would be beautiful if it weren't for the comments."

Do the next guy a favor, comment your code.
