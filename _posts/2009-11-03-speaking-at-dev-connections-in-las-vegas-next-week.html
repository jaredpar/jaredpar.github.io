<p>Next week I will be speaking at <a href="http://www.devconnections.com/shows/FALL2009VS/default.asp?s=136">Dev Connections</a> in Las Vegas.&#160; I will be running the following sessions</p>  <ul>   <li>VMS02: Future Directions for Visual Basic</li>    <li>VMS04: Microsoft Visual Basic IDE Tips and Tricks</li> </ul>  <p>Both of these talks will spend a bit of time talking about all of the progress and exciting new features we’ve added in Dev10.&#160; Given I primarily work on the IDE these days, expect a bit of IDE content to work it’s way into the Future Directions talk as well.&#160; </p></div>
