<p>My blogging tool is Windows Live Writer and I use the &quot;Insert From Visual Studio&quot; plug-in to get pretty looking code into my postings.&#160; The generated code uses the &lt;pre&gt; tag for formatting the elements.&#160; </p>  <p>Unfortunately my blog provider doesn't always render this properly and will clip text that is too long.&#160; Ideally I would like to either </p>  <ol>   <li>Wrap code that overflows the page </li>    <li>Put up a localized scroll bar for the code snippet </li> </ol>  <p>Luckily the plug-in puts the outer most &lt;pre&gt; tag into it's own CSS class: code.&#160; This makes the problem easy with a CSS override.</p>  <p>pre.code {    <br />&#160; overflow : auto;     <br />}</p></div>
