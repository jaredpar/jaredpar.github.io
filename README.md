Paranoid Coding Blog
==================

This is the blog site for [blog.paranoidcoding.org][1]. The site is built using Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. The blog contains all of the parts of my job that I've found interesting enough to write about.

To run the site locally 

1. Open the site in the provided dev container
2. Run `./scripts/container-start.sh` to start jekyll if it's not already running
3. Locally browse to `http://localhost:4000` to see the site
